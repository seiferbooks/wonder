Ordinary</H1>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.18in; line-height: 115%">
I know I'm not an ordinary ten-year-old kid. I mean, sure, I do
ordinary things. I eat ice cream. I ride my bike. I play ball. I have
an XBox. Stuff like that makes me ordinary. I guess. And I feel
ordinary. Inside. But I know ordinary kids don't make other ordinary
kids run away screaming in playgrounds. I know ordinary kids don't
get stared at wherever they go.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
If I found a magic lamp and I could have one wish, I would wish that
I had a normal face that no one ever noticed at all. I would wish
that I could walk down the street without people seeing me and then
doing that look-away thing. Here's what I think: the only reason I'm
not ordinary is that no one else sees me that way.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
But I'm kind of used to how I look by now. I know how to pretend I
don't see the faces people make. We've all gotten pretty good at that
sort of thing: me, Mom and Dad, Via. Actually, I take that back:
Via's not so good at it. She can get really annoyed when people do
something rude. Like, for instance, one time in the playground some
older kids made some noises. I don't even know what the noises were
exactly because I didn't hear them myself, but Via heard and she just
started yelling at the kids. That's the way she is. I'm not that way.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Via doesn't see me as ordinary. She says she does, but if I were
ordinary, she wouldn't feel like she needs to protect me  as much.
And Mom and Dad don't see me as ordinary, either. They see me as
extraordinary. I think the only person in the world who realizes how
ordinary I am is me.</P>

Why I Didn't Go to School</H1>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.17in; margin-top: 0.18in; line-height: 115%">
Next week I start fifth grade. Since I've never been to a real school
before, I am pretty much totally and completely petrified. People
think I haven't gone to school because of the way I look, but it's
not that. It's because of all the surgeries I've had. Twenty-seven
since I was born. The bigger ones happened before I was even four
years old, so I don't remember those. But I've had two or three
surgeries every year since then (some big, some small), and because
I'm little for my age, and I have some other medical mysteries that
doctors never really figured out, I used to get sick a lot. That's
why my parents decided it was better if I didn't go to school. I'm
much stronger now, though.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0in; line-height: 115%">
The last surgery I had was eight months ago, and I probably won't
have to have any more for another couple of years.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Mom homeschools me. She used to be a children's-book illustrator. She
draws really great fairies and mermaids. Her boy stuff isn't so hot,
though. She once tried to draw me a Darth Vader, but it ended up
looking like some weird mushroom-shaped robot. I haven't seen her
draw anything in a long time. I think she's too busy taking care of
me and Via.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.17in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
I can't say I always wanted to go to school because that wouldn't be
exactly true. What I wanted was to go to school, but only if I could
be like every other kid going to school. Have lots of friends and
hang out after school and stuff like that.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.11in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
I have a few really good friends now. Christopher is my best friend,
followed by Zachary and Alex. We've known each other since we were
babies. And since they've always known me the way I am, they're used
to me. When we were little, we used to have playdates all the time,
but then Christopher moved to Bridgeport in Connecticut. That's more
than an hour away from where I live in North River Heights, which is
at the top tip of Manhattan. And Zachary and Alex started going to
school. It's funny: even though Christopher's the one who moved far
away, I still see him more than I see Zachary and Alex. They have all
these new friends now. If we bump into each other on the street,
they're still nice to me, though. They always say hello.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
I have other friends, too, but not as good as Christopher and Zack
and Alex were. For instance, Zack and Alex always invited me to their
birthday parties when we were little, but Joel and Eamonn and Gabe
never did. Emma invited me once, but I haven't seen her in a long
time. And, of course, I always go to Christopher's birthday. Maybe
I'm making too big a deal about birthday parties.</P>

How I Came to Life</H1>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.18in; line-height: 115%">
I like when Mom tells this story because it makes me laugh so much.
It's not funny in the way a joke is funny, but when Mom tells it, Via
and I just start cracking up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.14in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
So when I was in my mom's stomach, no one had any idea I would come
out looking the way I look. Mom had had Via four years before, and
that had been such a &quot;walk in the park&quot; (Mom's expression)
that there was no reason to run any special tests. About two months
before I was born, the doctors realized there was something wrong
with my face, but they didn't think it was going to be bad. They told
Mom and Dad I had a cleft palate and some other stuff going on. They
called it &quot;small anomalies.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
There were two nurses in the delivery room the night I was  born. One
was very nice and sweet. The other one, Mom said, did not seem at all
nice or sweet. She had very big arms and (here comes the funny part),
she kept farting. Like, she'd  bring Mom some ice chips, and then
fart. She'd check Mom's blood pressure, and fart. Mom says it was
unbelievable because the nurse never even said excuse me! Meanwhile,
Mom's regular doctor wasn't on duty that night, so Mom got stuck with
this cranky kid doctor she and Dad nicknamed Doogie after some old TV
show or something (they didn't actually call him that to his face).
But Mom says that even though everyone in the room was kind of
grumpy, Dad kept making her laugh all night long.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
When I came out of Mom's stomach, she said the whole room got very
quiet. Mom didn't even get a chance to look at me because the nice
nurse immediately rushed me out of the room. Dad was in such a hurry
to follow her that he dropped the video camera, which broke into a
million pieces.  And then Mom got very upset and tried to get out of
bed to  see where they were going, but the farting nurse put her very
 big arms on Mom to keep her down in the bed. They were practically
fighting, because Mom was hysterical and the farting nurse was
yelling at her to stay calm, and then they both started screaming for
the doctor. But guess what? He had fainted! Right on the floor! So
when the farting nurse saw that he had fainted, she started pushing
him with her foot to get him to wake up, yelling at him the whole
time: &quot;What kind of doctor are you? What kind of doctor are you?
Get up! Get up!&quot; And then all of a sudden she let out the
biggest, loudest, smelliest fart in the history of farts. Mom thinks
it was actually the fart that finally woke the doctor Anyway, when
Mom tells this story, she acts out all the parts—including the
farting noises—and it is so, so, so, so funny!</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Mom says the farting nurse turned out to be a very nice woman. She
stayed with Mom the whole time. Didn't leave her side even after Dad
came back and the doctors told them how sick I was. Mom remembers
exactly what the nurse whispered in her ear when the doctor told her
I probably wouldn't live through the night: &quot;Everyone born of</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: always">
God overcometh the world.&quot; And the next day, after I had lived
through the night, it was that nurse who held Mom's hand when they
brought her to meet me for the first time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Mom says by then they had told her all about me. She had been
preparing herself for the seeing of me. But she says that when she
looked down into my tiny mushed-up face for the first time, all she
could see was how pretty my eyes were.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">

I don't know how long I was sleeping, but when I woke up, there was a
full moon outside the car window. It was a purple night, and we were
driving on a highway full of cars. And then I heard Mom and Dad
talking about me.</P>

&quot;We can't keep protecting him,&quot; Mom whispered to Dad, who
was driving. &quot;We can't just pretend he's going to wake up
tomorrow and this isn't going to be his reality, because it is, Nate,
and we have to help him learn to deal with it. We can't just keep
avoiding situations that . . .&quot;</P>

I would have been more nervous about meeting Mr. Tushman if I'd known
I was also going to be meeting some kids from the new school. But I
didn't know, so if anything, I was kind of giggly. I couldn't stop
thinking about all the jokes Daddy had made about Mr. Tushman's name.
So when me and Mom arrived at Beecher Prep a few weeks before the
start of school, and I saw Mr. Tushman standing there, waiting for us
at the entrance, I started giggling right away. He didn't look at all
like what I pictured, though. I guess I thought he would have a huge
butt, but he didn't. In fact, he  was a pretty normal guy. Tall and
thin. Old but not really old. He seemed nice. He shook my mom's hand
first.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;Hi,

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;Like

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; I said, nodding. &quot;We have a couple of great

I think he wanted me to take his hand, but I took Mom's instead. He
smiled and started walking toward the entrance. Mommy gave my hand a
little squeeze, though I don't know if it was an &quot;I love you&quot;

both.</P>

We followed Mr. Tushman down a few hallways. There weren't a lot of
people around. And the few people who were there didn't seem to
notice me at all, though that may have been because they didn't see
me. I sort of hid behind Mom as I walked. I know that sounds kind of
babyish of me, but I wasn't feeling very brave right then.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.52in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">

to the side a bit, so I would move forward. Then that thing happened
that I've seen happen a million times before. When I looked up at

else would have noticed, since the rest of her face stayed exactly
the same. She was smiling a really shiny smile.</P>

&quot;You can call me Mrs. G,&quot; Mrs. Garcia said. I think she was
talking to me, but I was looking at all the stuff on her desk now.
&quot;That's what everyone calls me. Mrs. G, I forgot my combination.
Mrs. G, I need a late pass. Mrs. G, I want to change my elective.&quot;</P>

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;No, my goodness!&quot; said Mrs. Garcia, smiling a big smile
now that was totally different from her shiny smile. &quot;You've
just made my day. He's my grandson.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;What
a cutie!&quot; said Mom, shaking her head. &quot;How old?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0.01in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&quot;In that picture he was five
months, I think. But he's big now. Almost eight years old!&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.12in; margin-top: 0.05in; page-break-before: always">
&quot;Wow,&quot; said Mom, nodding and smiling. &quot;Well, he is
absolutely beautiful.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Thank you!&quot; said Mrs. Garcia, nodding like she was about
to say something else about her grandson. But then all of a sudden
her smile got a little smaller. &quot;We're all going to take very
good care of August,&quot; she said to Mom, and I saw her  give Mom's
hand a little squeeze. I looked at Mom's face, and that's when I
realized she was just as nervous as I was. I guess I liked Mrs.
Garcia—when she wasn't wearing her shiny smile.</P>

Will, Julian, and Charlotte</H1>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.18in; line-height: 115%">
We followed Mr. Tushman into a small room across from Mrs. Garcia's
desk. He was talking as he closed the door to his office and sat down
behind his big desk, though I wasn't really paying much attention to
what he was saying. I was looking around at all the things on his
desk. Cool stuff, like a globe that floated in the air and a
Rubik's-type cube made with little mirrors. I liked his office a lot.
I liked that there were all these neat little drawings and paintings
by students on the walls, framed like they were important.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.05in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Mom sat down in a chair in front of Mr. Tushman's desk, and even
though there was another chair right next to hers, I decided to stand
beside her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 1.91in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 186%">
&quot;Why do you have your own room and Mrs. G doesn't?&quot; I said.
&quot;You mean, why do I have an office?&quot; asked Mr. Tushman.
&quot;You said she runs the place,&quot; I said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0in">&quot;Oh!
Well, I was kind of kidding. Mrs. G is my assistant.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 1.43in; text-indent: 0.05in; line-height: 186%">
&quot;Mr. Tushman is the director of the middle school,&quot; Mom
explained. &quot;Do they call you Mr. T?&quot; I asked, which made
him smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Do you know who Mr. T is?&quot; he answered. &quot;I pity the
fool?&quot; he said in a funny tough voice, like he was imitating
someone.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">I had no
idea what he was talking about.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0.01in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Anyway, no,&quot; said Mr. Tushman, shaking his head. &quot;No
one calls me Mr. T. Though I have a feeling I'm called a lot of other
things I don't know about. Let's face it, a name like mine is not so
easy to live with, you know what I mean?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.73in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 187%">
Here I have to admit I totally laughed, because I knew exactly what
he meant. &quot;My mom and dad had a teacher called Miss Butt,&quot;
I said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.05in; page-break-before: always">
&quot;Auggie!&quot; said Mom, but Mr. Tushman laughed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&quot;Now, that's bad,&quot; said
Mr. Tushman, shaking his head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0.01in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.26in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;I guess I shouldn't complain. Hey, so listen, August, here's
what I thought we would do today. . . .&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 187%">
&quot;Is that a pumpkin?&quot; I said, pointing to a framed painting
behind Mr. Tushman's desk. &quot;Auggie, sweetie, don't interrupt,&quot;
said Mom.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.11in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;You like it?&quot; said Mr. Tushman, turning around and looking
at the painting. &quot;I do, too. And I thought it was a pumpkin,
too, until the student who gave it to me explained that it is
actually not a pumpkin. It is . . . are you ready for this . . . a
portrait of me! Now, August, I ask you: do I really look that much
like a pumpkin?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;No!&quot; I answered, though I was thinking yes. Something
about the way his cheeks puffed out when he smiled made him look like
a jack-o'-lantern. Just as I thought that, it occurred to me how
funny that was: cheeks, Mr. Tushman. And I started laughing a little.
I shook my head and covered my mouth with my hand.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">Mr.
Tushman smiled like he could read my mind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0.01in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; line-height: 115%">
I was about to say something else, but then all of a sudden I heard
other voices outside the office: kids' voices. I'm not exaggerating
when I say this, but my heart literally started beating like I'd just
run the longest race in the world. The laughter I had inside just
poured out of me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.11in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
The thing is, when I was little, I never minded meeting new kids
because all the kids I met were really little, too. What's cool about
really little kids is that they don't say stuff to try to hurt your
feelings, even though sometimes they do say stuff that hurts your
feelings. But they don't actually know what they're saying. Big kids,
though: they know what they're saying. And that is definitely not fun
for me. One of the reasons I grew my hair long last year was that I
like how my bangs cover my eyes: it helps me block out the things I
don't want to see.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 1.76in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 186%">
Mrs. Garcia knocked on the door and poked her head inside. &quot;They're
here, Mr. Tushman,&quot; she said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0in">&quot;Who's
here?&quot; I said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0.01in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Thanks,&quot; said Mr. Tushman to Mrs. Garcia. &quot;August, I
thought it would be a good idea for you to meet some students who'll
be in your homeroom this year. I figure they could take you around
the school a bit, show you the lay of the land, so to speak.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.05in; page-break-before: always">
&quot;I don't want to meet anyone,&quot; I said to Mom.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; line-height: 115%">
Mr. Tushman was suddenly right in front of me, his hands on my
shoulders. He leaned down and said very softly in my ear: &quot;It'll
be okay, August. These are nice kids, I promise.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;You're
going to be okay, Auggie,&quot; Mom whispered with all her might.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0.01in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Before she could say anything else,
Mr. Tushman opened the door to his office.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.35in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Come on in, kids,&quot; he said, and in walked two boys and a
girl. None of them looked over at me or Mom: they stood by the door
looking straight at Mr. Tushman like their lives depended on it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Thanks so much for coming, guys—especially since school
doesn't start until next month!&quot; said Mr. Tushman. &quot;Have
you had a good summer?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">All of
them nodded but no one said anything.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0.01in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Great, great,&quot; said Mr. Tushman. &quot;So, guys, I wanted
you to meet August, who's going to be a new student here this year.
August, these guys have been students at Beecher Prep since
kindergarten, though, of course, they were in the lowerschool
building, but they know all the ins and outs of the middle-school
program. And since you're all in the same homeroom, I thought it
would be nice if you got to know each other a little before school
started. Okay? So, kids, this is August. August, this is Jack Will.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Jack Will looked at me and put out his hand. When I shook it, he kind
of half smiled and said: &quot;Hey,&quot; and looked down really
fast.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.05in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;This is Julian,&quot; said Mr. Tushman. &quot;Hey,&quot; said
Julian, and did the same exact thing as Jack Will: took my hand,
forced a smile, looked down fast.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;And
Charlotte,&quot; said Mr. Tushman.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0.01in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; line-height: 115%">
Charlotte had the blondest hair I've ever seen. She didn't shake my
hand but gave me a quick little wave and smiled. &quot;Hi, August.
Nice to meet you,&quot; she said. &quot;Hi,&quot; I said, looking
down. She was wearing bright green Crocs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.11in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;So,&quot; said Mr. Tushman, putting his hands together in a
kind of slow clap. &quot;What I thought you guys could do is take
August on a little tour of the school. Maybe you could start on the
third floor? That's where your homeroom class is going to be: room
301. I think. Mrs. G, is—&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;Room
301!&quot; Mrs. Garcia called out from the other room.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.24in; margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: always">
&quot;Room 301.&quot; Mr. Tushman nodded. &quot;And then you can show
August the science labs and the computer room. Then work your way
down to the library and the performance space on the second floor.
Take him to the cafeteria, of course.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.12in; margin-top: 0.14in">
&quot;Should we take him to the music room?&quot; asked Julian.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&quot;Good idea, yes,&quot; said Mr.
Tushman. &quot;August, do you play any instruments?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0.01in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.05in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;No,&quot; I said. It wasn't my favorite subject on account of
the fact that I don't really have ears. Well, I do, but they don't
exactly look like normal ears.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Well, you may enjoy seeing the music room anyway,&quot; said
Mr. Tushman. &quot;We have a very nice selection of percussion
instruments.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;August, you've been wanting to learn to play the drums,&quot;
Mom said, trying to get me to look at her. But my eyes were covered
by my bangs as I stared at a piece of old gum that was stuck to the
bottom of Mr. Tushman's desk.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Great! Okay, so why don't you guys get going?&quot; said Mr.
Tushman. &quot;Just be back here in . . .&quot; He looked at Mom.
&quot;Half an hour, okay?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">I think
Mom nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0.01in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&quot;So, is that okay with you,
August?&quot; he asked me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.16in; line-height: 115%">
I didn't answer. &quot;Is that okay, August?&quot; Mom repeated. I
looked at her now. I wanted her to see how mad I was at her. But then
I saw her face and just nodded. She seemed more scared than I was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">The other
kids had started out the door, so I followed them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0.01in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;See you soon,&quot; said Mom, her voice sounding a little
higher than normal. I didn't answer her.</P>

<H1 CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 2.49in">The
Grand Tour</H1>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.18in; line-height: 115%">
Jack Will, Julian, Charlotte, and I went down a big hallway to some
wide stairs. No one said a word as we walked up to the third floor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
When we got to the top of the stairs, we went down a little hallway
full of lots of doors. Julian opened the door marked 301.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;This is our homeroom,&quot; he said, standing in front of the
half-opened door. &quot;We have Ms. Petosa. They say she's okay, at
least for homeroom. I heard she's really strict if you get her for
math, though.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.05in; page-break-before: always">
&quot;That's not true,&quot; said Charlotte. &quot;My sister had her
last year and said she's totally nice.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.05in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Not what I heard,&quot; answered Julian, &quot;but whatever.&quot;
He closed the door and continued walking down the hallway.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;This is the science lab,&quot; he said when he got to the next
door. And just like he did two seconds ago, he stood in front of the
half-opened door and started talking. He didn't look at me once while
he talked, which was okay because I wasn't looking at him, either.
&quot;You won't know who you have for science until the first day of
school, but you want to get Mr. Haller. He used to be in the lower
school. He would play this giant tuba in class.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.12in; margin-top: 0.14in">
&quot;It was a baritone horn,&quot; said Charlotte.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&quot;It was a tuba!&quot; answered
Julian, closing the door.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0.01in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 115%">&quot;Dude,
let him go inside so he can check it out,&quot; Jack Will told him,
pushing past Julian and opening the door.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;Go
inside if you want,&quot; Julian said. It was the first time he
looked at me. I</P>

<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; text-indent: 0.05in; line-height: 115%">
shrugged and walked over to the door. Julian moved out of the way
quickly, like he was afraid I might accidentally touch him as I
passed by him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Nothing much to see,&quot; Julian said, walking in after me. He
started pointing to a bunch of stuff around the room. &quot;That's
the incubator. That big black thing is the chalkboard. These are the
desks. These are chairs. Those are the Bunsen burners. This is a
gross science poster. This is chalk. This is the eraser.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;I'm
sure he knows what an eraser is,&quot; Charlotte said, sounding a
little like Via.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0.01in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 115%">&quot;How
would I know what he knows?&quot; Julian answered. &quot;Mr. Tushman
said he's never been to a school before.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;You
know what an eraser is, right?&quot; Charlotte asked me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0in">

</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 115%">I admit I
was feeling so nervous that I didn't know what to say or do except
look at the floor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;Hey,
can you talk?&quot; asked Jack Will.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0.01in">

</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.12in; margin-right: 0.73in; line-height: 187%">
&quot;Yeah.&quot; I nodded. I still really hadn't looked at any of
them yet, not directly. &quot;You know what an eraser is, right?&quot;
asked Jack Will.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 0.19in">&quot;Of
course!&quot; I mumbled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.05in; page-break-before: always">
&quot;I told you there was nothing to see in here,&quot; said Julian,
shrugging.</P>

<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 115%">&quot;I
have a question . . . ,&quot; I said, trying to keep my voice steady.
&quot;Um. What exactly is homeroom? Is that like a subject?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.17in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;No, that's just your group,&quot; explained Charlotte, ignoring
Julian's smirk. &quot;It's like where you go when you get to school
in the morning and your homeroom teacher takes attendance and stuff
like that. In a way, it's your main class even though  it's not
really a class. I mean, it's a class, but—&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 3.37in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 187%">
&quot;I think he gets it, Charlotte,&quot; said Jack Will. &quot;Do
you get it?&quot; Charlotte asked me. &quot;Yeah.&quot; I nodded at
her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 0.19in">&quot;Okay,
let's get out of here,&quot; said Jack Will, walking away.</P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 1.01in; line-height: 187%">
&quot;Wait, Jack, we're supposed to be answering questions,&quot;
said Charlotte. Jack Will rolled his eyes a little as he turned
around.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 0.19in">&quot;Do
you have any more questions?&quot; he asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.73in; line-height: 186%">
&quot;Um, no,&quot; I answered. &quot;Oh, well, actually, yes. Is
your name Jack or Jack Will?&quot; &quot;Jack is my first name. Will
is my last name.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 1.01in; margin-top: 0in; line-height: 186%">
&quot;Oh, because Mr. Tushman introduced you as Jack Will, so I
thought . . .&quot; &quot;Ha! You thought his name was Jackwill!&quot;
laughed Julian.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Yeah, some people call me by my first and last name,&quot; Jack
said, shrugging. &quot;I don't know why. Anyway, can we go now?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.05in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.18in; line-height: 115%">
Charlotte basically didn't stop talking as we headed down to the
second floor. She was describing the play they had put on last year,
which was Oliver! She played Oliver even though she's a girl. As she
said this, she pushed open the double doors to a huge auditorium. At
the other end of the room was a stage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Charlotte started skipping toward the stage. Julian ran after her,
and then turned around halfway down the aisle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.05in; page-break-before: always">
&quot;Come on!&quot; he said loudly, waving for me to follow him,
which I did.</P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;There were like hundreds of people in the audience that night,&quot;
said Charlotte, and it took me a second to realize she was still
talking about Oliver! &quot;I was so, so nervous. I had so many
lines, and I had all these songs to sing. It was so, so, so, so
hard!&quot; Although she was talking to me, she really didn't look at
me much. &quot;On opening night, my parents were all the way in back
of the auditorium, like where Jack is right now, but when the lights
are off, you can't really see that far back. So I was like, 'Where
are my parents? Where are my parents?' And then Mr. Resnick, our
theater-arts teacher last year—he said: 'Charlotte, stop being such
a diva!' And I was like, 'Okay!' And then I spotted my parents and I
was totally fine. I didn't forget a single line.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.14in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
While she was talking, I noticed Julian staring at me out of the
corner of his eye. This is something I see people do a lot with me.
They think I don't know they're staring, but I can tell from the way
their heads are tilted. I turned around to  see where Jack had gone
to. He had stayed in the back of the auditorium, like he was bored.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;We
put on a play every year,&quot; said Charlotte.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0in">

</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 115%">&quot;I
don't think he's going to want to be in the school play, Charlotte,&quot;
said Julian sarcastically.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.11in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;You can be in the play without actually being 'in' the play,&quot;
Charlotte answered, looking at me. &quot;You can do the lighting. You
can paint the backdrops.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;Oh
yeah, whoopee,&quot; said Julian, twirling his finger in the air.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0.01in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 115%">&quot;But
you don't have to take the theater-arts elective if you don't want
to,&quot; Charlotte said, shrugging. &quot;There's dance or chorus or
band. There's leadership.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;Only
dorks take leadership,&quot; Julian interrupted.</P>

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.73in; margin-top: 0in; line-height: 187%">
&quot;Julian, you're being so obnoxious!&quot; said Charlotte, which
made Julian laugh. &quot;I'm taking the science elective,&quot; I
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 0.19in">&quot;Cool!&quot;
said Charlotte.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0.01in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; line-height: 115%">
Julian looked directly at me. &quot;The science elective is
supposably the hardest elective of all,&quot; he said. &quot;No
offense, but if you've never, ever been in a school before, why do
you think you're suddenly going to be smart enough to take the
science elective? I mean, have you ever even studied science before?
Like real science, not like the kind you do in kits?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;Yeah.&quot;
I nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.05in; page-break-before: always">
&quot;He was homeschooled, Julian!&quot; said Charlotte.</P>

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 1.76in; line-height: 186%">
&quot;So teachers came to his house?&quot; asked Julian, looking
puzzled. &quot;No, his mother taught him!&quot; answered Charlotte.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0in">&quot;Is she
a teacher?&quot; Julian said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0.01in">

</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&quot;Is your mother a teacher?&quot;

</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.26in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;No,&quot; I said. &quot;So she's not a real teacher!&quot; said
Julian, as if that proved his point. &quot;That's what I mean. How
can someone who's not a real teacher actually teach science?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;I'm
sure you'll do fine,&quot; said Charlotte, looking at me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0.01in">

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&quot;Let's just go to the library

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.66in; line-height: 187%">
&quot;Why is your hair so long?&quot; Julian said to me. He sounded
like he was annoyed. I didn't know what to say, so I just shrugged.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 0.19in">&quot;Can
I ask you a question?&quot; he said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I shrugged again. Didn't he just ask
me a question?</P>

&quot;What's the deal with your face? I mean, were you in a fire or
something?&quot; &quot;Julian, that's so rude!&quot; said Charlotte.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;I'm not being rude,&quot; said Julian, &quot;I'm just asking a
question. Mr. Tushman said we could ask questions if we wanted to.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.13in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Not rude questions like that,&quot; said Charlotte. &quot;Besides,
he was born like that. That's what Mr. Tushman said. You just weren't
listening.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.73in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 187%">
&quot;I was so listening!&quot; said Julian. &quot;I just thought
maybe he was in a fire, too.&quot; &quot;Geez, Julian,&quot; said
Jack. &quot;Just shut up.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 0.19in">&quot;You

I walked toward Jack and followed him out of the auditorium. He held
the double doors open for me, and as I passed by, he looked at me
right in the face, kind of daring me to look back at him, which I
did. Then I actually smiled. I don't know. Sometimes when I have the
feeling like I'm almost crying, it can turn into an almost-laughing
feeling. And</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.22in; margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: always">
that must have been the feeling I was having then, because I smiled,
almost like I was going to giggle. The thing is, because of the way
my face is, people who don't know me very well don't always get that
I'm smiling. My mouth doesn't go up at the corners the way other
people's mouths do. It just goes straight across my face. But somehow
Jack Will got that I had smiled at him. And he smiled back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Julian's a jerk,&quot; he whispered before Julian and Charlotte
reached us. &quot;But, dude, you're gonna have to talk.&quot; He said
this seriously, like he was trying to help me. I nodded as Julian and
Charlotte caught up to us. We were all quiet for a second, all of us
just kind of nodding, looking at the floor. Then I looked up at
Julian.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 3.26in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 186%">
&quot;The word's 'supposedly,' by the way,&quot; I said. &quot;What
are you talking about?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0in">&quot;You
said 'supposably' before,&quot; I said. &quot;I did not!&quot;</P>

<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 115%">&quot;Yeah
you did,&quot; Charlotte nodded. &quot;You said the science elective
is supposably really hard. I heard you.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 3.81in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 187%">
&quot;I absolutely did not,&quot; he insisted. &quot;Whatever,&quot;
said Jack. &quot;Let's just go.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.12in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Yeah, let's just go,&quot; agreed Charlotte, following Jack
down the stairs to the next floor. I started to follow her, but
Julian cut right in front of me, which actually made me stumble
backward.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;Oops,
sorry about that!&quot; said Julian.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0.01in">

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.18in; line-height: 115%">
Mom and Mr. Tushman were talking when we got back to the office. Mrs.
Garcia was the first to see us come back, and she started smiling her
shiny smile as we walked in.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.73in; text-indent: 0.09in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 186%">
&quot;So, August, what did you think? Did you like what you saw?&quot;
she asked. &quot;Yeah.&quot; I nodded, looking over at Mom.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.31in; margin-top: 0in; line-height: 115%">
Jack, Julian, and Charlotte were standing by the door, not sure where
to go or if they were still needed. I wondered what else they'd been
told about me before they'd met me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.05in; page-break-before: always">
&quot;Did you see the baby chick?&quot; Mom asked me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 115%">As I shook
my head, Julian said: &quot;Are you talking about the baby chicks in
science? Those get donated to a farm at the end of every school
year.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.05in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Oh,&quot; said Mom, disappointed. &quot;But they hatch new ones
every year in science,&quot; Julian added. &quot;So August will be
able to see them again in the spring.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;Oh,
good,&quot; said Mom, eyeing me. &quot;They were so cute, August.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0in">

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I wished she wouldn't talk to me

</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 115%">&quot;So,
August,&quot; said Mr. Tushman, &quot;did these guys show you around
enough or do you want to see more? I realize I forgot to ask them to
show you the gym.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 3.27in; text-indent: 0.05in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 187%">
&quot;We did anyway, Mr. Tushman,&quot; said Julian. &quot;Excellent!&quot;
said Mr. Tushman.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;And I told him about the school play and some of the
electives,&quot; said Charlotte. &quot;Oh no!&quot; she said
suddenly. &quot;We forgot to show him the art room!&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.13in">&quot;That's
okay,&quot; said Mr. Tushman.</P>

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 2.76in; line-height: 186%">
&quot;But we can show it to him now,&quot; Charlotte offered. &quot;Don't
we have to pick Via up soon?&quot; I said to Mom.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0in">That was our
signal for my telling Mom if I really wanted to leave.</P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.11in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Oh, you're right,&quot; said Mom, getting up. I could tell she
was pretending to check the time on her watch. &quot;I'm sorry,
everybody. I lost track of the time. We have to go pick up my
daughter at her new school. She's taking an unofficial tour today.&quot;
This part wasn't a lie: that Via was checking out her new school
today. The part that was a lie was that we were picking her up at the
school, which we weren't. She was coming home with Dad later.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 1.76in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 187%">
&quot;Where does she go to school?&quot; asked Mr. Tushman, getting

</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.21in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Mom, nodding. &quot;It'll be a bit of a
schlep, though. The A train down to Eighty-Sixth, then the crosstown
bus all the way to the East Side. Takes an hour that way but it's
just a fifteen-minute drive.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: always">
&quot;It'll be worth it. I know a couple of kids who got into

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0in; line-height: 115%">
We said goodbye kind of quickly after that. I think Mr. Tushman was a
little surprised that we were leaving so suddenly, and then I
wondered if he would blame Jack and Charlotte, even though it was
really only Julian who made me feel kind of bad.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.12in; margin-top: 0.14in">

As soon as we had walked at least half a block from the school, Mom

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Not yet, Mom. When we get home,&quot; I said. The moment we got
inside the house, I ran to my room and threw myself onto my bed. I
could tell Mom didn't know what was up, and I guess I really didn't,
either. I felt very sad and a tiny bit happy at the exact same time,
kind of like that laughing-crying feeling all over again.</P>

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;Oh

&quot;Uh-huh.&quot; I nodded, but I kept looking at Daisy, kissing
her on the nose and rubbing her ear until her back leg did that
little flea-scratch shake.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;That

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Oh.&quot; She thought about this for a second. &quot;Okay, so

way in front of kids?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.13in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Yeah, I guess.&quot; &quot;Ah, hate those,&quot; she answered,

you in a fire or something?' &quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">

And I wasn't lying.</P>

First-Day Jitters</H1>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.18in; line-height: 115%">
Okay, so I admit that the first day of school I was so nervous that
the butterflies in my stomach were more like pigeons flying around my
insides. Mom and Dad were probably a little nervous, too, but they
acted all excited for me, taking pictures of me and Via before we
left the house since it was Via's first day of school, too.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.11in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Up until a few days before, we still weren't sure I would be going to
school at all. After my tour of the school, Mom and Dad had reversed
sides on whether I should go or not. Mom was now the one saying I
shouldn't go and Dad was saying I  should. Dad had told me he was
really proud of how I'd handled myself with Julian and that I was
turning into quite the strong man. And I heard him tell Mom that he
now thought she had been right all along. But Mom, I could tell,
wasn't so sure anymore. When Dad told her that he and Via wanted to
walk me to school today, too, since it was on the way to the subway
station, Mom seemed relieved that we would all be going together. And
I guess I was, too.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.26in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Even though Beecher Prep is just a few blocks from our house, I've
only been on that block a couple of times before. In general, I try
to avoid blocks where there are lots of kids roaming around. On our
block, everybody knows me and I know everybody. I know every brick
and every tree trunk and every crack in the sidewalk. I know Mrs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; line-height: 115%">
Grimaldi, the lady who's always sitting by her window, and the old
guy who walks up and down the street whistling like a bird. I know
the deli on the corner where Mom gets our bagels, and the waitresses
at the coffee shop who all call me &quot;honey&quot; and give me
lollipops whenever they see me. I love my neighborhood of North River
Heights, which is why it was so strange to be walking down these
blocks feeling like it was all new to me suddenly. Amesfort Avenue, a
street I've been down a million times, looked totally different for
some reason. Full of people I never saw before, waiting for buses,
pushing strollers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
We crossed Amesfort and turned up Heights Place: Via walked next to
me like she usually does, and Mom and Dad were behind us. As soon as
we turned the corner, we saw all the kids in front of the
school—hundreds of them talking to each other in little groups,
laughing, or standing with their parents, who were talking with other
parents. I kept my head way down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Everyone's just as nervous as you are,&quot; said Via in my
ear. &quot;Just remember that this is everyone's first day of school.
Okay?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">Mr.
Tushman was greeting students and parents in front of the school
entrance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 115%">I have to
admit: so far, nothing bad had happened. I didn't catch anyone
staring or even noticing me. Only once did I look up to see some
girls looking my way and whispering</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: always">
with their hands cupped over their mouths, but they looked away when
they saw me notice them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">We

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.66in; margin-top: 0in; line-height: 187%">
&quot;Okay, so this is it, big boy,&quot; said Dad, putting his hands
on top of my shoulders. &quot;Have a great first day. I love you,&quot;
said Via, giving me a big kiss and a hug. &quot;You, too,&quot; I
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 3.37in; line-height: 187%">
&quot;I love you, Auggie,&quot; said Dad, hugging me. &quot;Bye.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.27in; line-height: 115%">
Then Mom hugged me, but I could tell she was about to cry, which
would have totally embarrassed me, so I just gave her a fast hard
hug, turned, and disappeared into the school.</P>

I went straight to room 301 on the third floor. Now I was glad I'd
gone on that little tour, because I knew exactly where to go and
didn't have to look up once. I noticed that some kids were definitely
staring at me now. I did my thing of pretending not to notice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
I went inside the classroom, and the teacher was writing on the
chalkboard while all the kids started sitting at different desks. The
desks were in a half circle facing the chalkboard, so I chose the
desk in the middle toward the back, which I thought would make it
harder for anyone to stare at me. I still kept my head way down, just
looking up enough from under my bangs to see everyone's feet. As the
desks started  to fill up, I did notice that no one sat down next to
me. A couple of times someone was about to sit next to me, then
changed his or her mind at the last minute and sat somewhere else.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; text-indent: 0.05in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Hey, August.&quot; It was Charlotte, giving me her little wave
as she sat down at a desk in the front of the class. Why anyone would
ever choose to sit way up front in a class, I don't know.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Hey,&quot; I said, nodding hello. Then I noticed Julian was
sitting a few seats away from her, talking to some other kids. I know
he saw me, but he didn't say hello.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 1.01in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 187%">
Suddenly someone was sitting down next to me. It was Jack Will. Jack.
&quot;What's up,&quot; he said, nodding at me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: always">
&quot;Hey, Jack,&quot; I answered, waving my hand, which I
immediately wished I hadn't done because it felt kind of uncool.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Okay, kids, okay, everybody! Settle down,&quot; said the
teacher, now facing us. She had written her name, Ms. Petosa, on the
chalkboard. &quot;Everybody find a seat, please.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 115%">Come in,&quot;
she said to a couple of kids who had just walked in the room.
&quot;There's a seat there, and right there.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.13in">She
hadn't noticed me yet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 1.65in; text-indent: 0.05in; line-height: 186%">
&quot;Now, the first thing I want everyone to do is stop talking and
. . .&quot; She noticed me. &quot;. . . put your backpacks down and
quiet down.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0in; line-height: 115%">
She had only hesitated for a millionth of a second, but I could tell
the moment she saw me. Like I said: I'm used to it by now.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;I'm going to take attendance and do the seating chart,&quot;
she continued, sitting on the edge of her desk. Next to her were
three neat rows of accordion folders. &quot;When I call your name,
come up and I'll hand you a folder with your name on it. It contains
your class schedule and your combination lock, which you should not
try to open until I tell you to. Your locker number is written on the
class schedule. Be forewarned that some lockers are not right outside
this class but down the hall, and before anyone even thinks of
asking: no, you cannot switch lockers and you can't switch locks.
Then if there's time at the end of this period, we're all going to
get to know each other a little better, okay? Okay.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.16in; margin-right: 0.19in; text-indent: -0.09in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 187%">
She picked up the clipboard on her desk and started reading the names
out loud. &quot;Okay, so, Julian Albans?&quot; she said, looking up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 0.19in">Julian
raised his hand and said &quot;Here&quot; at the same time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Hi, Julian,&quot; she said, making a note on her seating chart.
She picked up the very first folder and held it out toward him. &quot;Come
pick it up,&quot; she said, kind of no-nonsense. He got up and took
it from her. &quot;Ximena Chin?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
She handed a folder to each kid as she read off the names. As she
went down the list, I noticed that the seat next to me was the only
one still empty, even though there were two kids sitting at one desk
just a few seats away. When she called the name of one of them, a big
kid named Henry Joplin who already looked like a teenager, she said:
&quot;Henry, there's an empty desk right over there. Why don't you
take that seat, okay?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; text-indent: 0.09in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
She handed him his folder and pointed to the desk next to mine.
Although I didn't look at him directly, I could tell Henry did not
want to move next to me, just by the way he</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.1in; margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: always">
dragged his backpack on the floor as he came over, like he was moving
in slow motion. Then he plopped his backpack up really high on the
right side of the desk so it was kind of like a wall between his desk
and mine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 2.86in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 186%">
&quot;Maya Markowitz?&quot; Ms. Petosa was saying. &quot;Here,&quot;
said a girl about four desks down from me. &quot;Miles Noury?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Here,&quot; said the kid that had been sitting with Henry
Joplin. As he walked back to his desk, I saw him shoot Henry a &quot;poor
you&quot; look.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;August Pullman?&quot; said Ms. Petosa. &quot;Here,&quot; I said
quietly, raising my hand a bit. &quot;Hi, August,&quot; she said,
smiling at me very nicely when I went up to get my folder. I kind of
felt everyone's eyes burning into my back for the few seconds I stood
in the front of the class, and everybody looked down when I walked
back to my desk. I resisted spinning the combination when I sat down,
even though everyone else was doing it, because she had specifically
told us not to. I was already pretty good at opening locks, anyway,
because I've used them on my  bike. Henry kept trying to open his
lock but couldn't do it. He was getting frustrated and kind of
cursing under his breath.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Ms. Petosa called out the next few names. The last name was Jack
Will. After she handed Jack his folder, she said: &quot;Okay, so,
everybody write your combinations down somewhere safe that you won't
forget, okay? But if you do forget, which happens at least three
point two times per semester, Mrs. Garcia has a list of all the
combination numbers. Now go ahead, take your locks out of your
folders and spend a couple of minutes practicing how to open them,
though I know some of you went ahead and did that anyway.&quot; She
was looking at Henry when she said that. &quot;And in the meanwhile,
I'll tell you guys a little something about myself. And then you guys
can tell me a little about yourselves and we'll, um, get to know each
other. Sound good? Good.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
She smiled at everyone, though I felt like she was smiling at me the
most. It wasn't a shiny smile, like Mrs. Garcia's smile, but a normal
smile, like she meant it. She looked very different from what I
thought teachers were going to look like. I guess I thought she'd
look like Miss Fowl from Jimmy Neutron: an old lady with a big bun on
top of her head. But, in fact, she looked exactly like Mon Mothma
from Star Wars Episode IV: haircut kind of like a boy's, and a big
white shirt kind of like a tunic.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
She turned around and started writing on the chalkboard. Henry still
couldn't get his lock to open, and he was getting more and more
frustrated every time someone else popped one open. He got really
annoyed when I was able to open mine on the first try.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: always">
The funny thing is, if he hadn't put the backpack between us, I most
definitely would have offered to help him.</P>

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.18in; line-height: 115%">
Ms. Petosa told us a little about who she was. It was boring stuff
about where she originally came from, and how she always wanted to
teach, and she left her job on Wall Street about six years ago to
pursue her &quot;dream&quot; and teach kids. She ended by asking if
anyone had any questions, and Julian raised his hand.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 1.76in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 186%">
&quot;Yes . . .&quot; She had to look at the list to remember his
name. &quot;Julian.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 1.76in; margin-top: 0in; line-height: 186%">
&quot;That's cool about how you're pursuing your dream,&quot; he
said. &quot;Thank you!&quot; &quot;You're welcome!&quot; He smiled
proudly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.16in; margin-top: 0in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Okay, so why don't you tell us a little about yourself, Julian?
Actually, here's what I want everyone to do. Think of two things you
want other people to know about you. Actually, wait a minute: how
many of you came from the Beecher lower school?&quot; About half the
kids raised their hands. &quot;Okay, so a few of you already know
each other. But the rest of you, I guess, are new to the school,
right? Okay, so everyone think of two things you want other people to
know about you—and if you know some of the other kids, try to think
of things they don't already know about you.  Okay? Okay. So let's
start with Julian and we'll go around the room.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Julian scrunched up his face and started tapping his forehead like he
was thinking really hard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 2.96in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 187%">
&quot;Okay, whenever you're ready,&quot; Ms. Petosa said. &quot;Okay,
so number one is that—&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 115%">&quot;Do
me a favor and start with your names, okay?&quot; Ms. Petosa
interrupted. &quot;It'll help me remember everyone.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Oh, okay. So my name is Julian. And the number one thing I'd
like to tell everyone about myself is that . . . I just got
Battleground Mystic for my Wii and it's totally awesome. And the
number two thing is that we got a Ping-Pong table this summer.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Very nice, I love Ping-Pong,&quot; said Ms. Petosa. &quot;Does
anyone have any questions for Julian?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;Is
Battleground Mystic multiplayer or one player?&quot; said the kid
named Miles.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.05in; page-break-before: always">

&quot;Oh, sure.&quot; Charlotte didn't hesitate for even a second,

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Who's your favorite character?&quot; Julian asked. I started

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;Jango

Now it was Jack's turn to talk, but I admit I didn't hear a word he
said. Maybe no one got the Darth Sidious thing, and maybe Julian
didn't mean anything at all. But in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of
the Sith, Darth Sidious's face gets burned by Sith lightning and
becomes totally deformed. His skin gets all shriveled up and his
whole face just kind of melts.</P>

There was a lot of shuffling around when the bell rang and everybody
got up to leave. I checked my schedule and it said my next class was
English, room 321. I didn't stop to see if anyone else from my
homeroom was going my way: I just zoomed out of the class and down
the hall and sat down as far from the front as possible. The teacher,
a really tall man with a yellow beard, was writing on the chalkboard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.15in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Kids came in laughing and talking in little groups but I didn't look
up. Basically, the same thing that happened in homeroom happened
again: no one sat next to me except for Jack, who was joking around
with some kids who weren't in our homeroom. I could tell Jack was the
kind of kid other kids like. He had a lot of friends. He made people
laugh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.14in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
When the second bell rang, everyone got quiet and the teacher turned
around and faced us. He said his name was Mr. Browne, and then he
started talking about what we would be doing this semester. At a
certain point, somewhere between <I>A Wrinkle in Time </I>and <I>Shen
of the Sea</I>, he noticed me but kept right on talking.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
I was mostly doodling in my notebook while he talked, but every once
in a while I would sneak a look at the other students. Charlotte was
in this class. So were Julian and Henry. Miles wasn't.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.05in; page-break-before: always">
Mr. Browne had written on the chalkboard in big block letters:</P>

decisions about really important things.&quot;</P>

A few kids raised their hands, and as he pointed at them, they gave

&quot;Okay,&quot; said Mr. Browne, writing all those things down. He
turned around when he finished writing to face us again. &quot;But no
one's named the most important thing of all.&quot; We all looked at
him, out of ideas. &quot;God?&quot; said one kid, and I could tell
that even though Mr. Browne wrote &quot;God&quot; down, that wasn't
the answer he was looking for.</P>

&quot;Okay, so, everybody,&quot; he said, facing us again, &quot;I

Mr. Browne's Precepts.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.57in; margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
He kept talking as we did what he was telling us to do. &quot;Put
today's date at the top of the first page. And from now  on, at the
beginning of every month, I'm going to write a new Mr. Browne precept
on the chalkboard and you're going to write it down in your notebook.
Then we're going to discuss that precept and what it means. And at
the end of the month, you're going to write an essay about</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.57in; margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: always">

&quot;Over the summer, I ask all my students to come up with their

from wherever you go on your summer vacation.&quot;</P>

He paused and stroked his beard. &quot;But, anyway, next summer seems
like a long way off, I know,&quot; he joked, which made us laugh.
&quot;So, everybody relax a bit while I take attendance, and then
when we're finished with that, I'll start telling you about all the
fun stuff we're going to be doing this year—in <I>English</I>.&quot;
He pointed to Jack when he said this, which was also funny, so we all
laughed at that.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.57in; text-indent: 0.05in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
As I wrote down Mr. Browne's September precept, I suddenly realized
that I was going to like school. No matter what.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 3.28in; margin-top: 0.14in">
Lunch</H2>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.57in; margin-right: 0.14in; margin-top: 0.17in; line-height: 115%">
Via had warned me about lunch in middle school, so I guess I should
have known it would be hard. I just hadn't expected it to be this
hard. Basically, all the kids from all the fifth-grade classes poured
into the cafeteria at the same time, talking loudly and bumping into
one another while they ran to different tables.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.57in; margin-right: 0.19in; line-height: 115%">
One of the lunchroom teachers said something about no seat-saving
allowed, but I didn't know what she meant and maybe no one else did,
either, because just about everybody was saving seats for their
friends. I tried to sit down at one table, but the kid in the next
chair said, &quot;Oh, sorry, but somebody else is sitting here.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.57in; margin-right: 0.22in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
So I moved to an empty table and just waited for everyone to finish
stampeding and the lunchroom teacher to tell us what to do next. As
she started telling us the cafeteria rules, I looked around to see
where Jack Will was sitting, but I didn't see him on my side of the
room. Kids were still coming in as the teachers started calling the
first few tables to get their trays and stand on line at the counter.
Julian, Henry, and Miles were sitting at a table toward the back of
the room.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.57in; margin-right: 0.11in; margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: always">
Mom had packed me a cheese sandwich, graham crackers, and a juice
box, so I didn't need to stand on line when my table was called.
Instead, I just concentrated on opening my backpack, pulling out my
lunch bag, and slowly opening the aluminum-foil wrapping of my
sandwich.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.57in; margin-right: 0.15in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
I could tell I was being stared at without even looking up. I knew
that people were nudging each other, watching me out of the corners
of their eyes. I thought I was used to those kinds of stares by now,
but I guess I wasn't.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.57in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
There was one table of girls that I knew were whispering about me
because they were talking behind their hands. Their eyes and whispers
kept bouncing over to me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.57in; margin-right: 0.11in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
I hate the way I eat. I know how weird it looks. I had a surgery to
fix my cleft palate when I was a baby, and then a second cleft
surgery when I was four, but I still have a hole in the roof of my
mouth. And even though I had jaw-alignment surgery a few years ago, I
have to chew food in the front of my mouth. I didn't even realize how
this looked until I was at a birthday party once, and one of the kids
told the mom of the birthday boy he didn't want to sit next to me
because I was too messy with all the food crumbs shooting out of my
mouth. I know the kid wasn't trying to be mean, but he got in big
trouble later, and his mom called my mom that night to apologize.
When I got home from the party, I went to the bathroom mirror and
started eating a saltine cracker to see what I looked like when I was
chewing. The kid was right. I eat like a tortoise, if you've ever
seen a tortoise eating. Like some prehistoric swamp thing.</P>

I looked up, and a girl I never saw before was standing across from
my table with a lunch tray full of food. She had long wavy brown
hair, and wore a brown T-shirt with a purple peace sign on it.</P>

The other girl looked confused for a second. I realized she had been

earlier: hand cupped over her mouth, whispering. I guess Summer had
been one of the girls at that table, too.</P>

By the end of lunch, we had come up with a whole list of names of
kids and teachers who could sit at our table if they wanted. Most of
the names weren't actually summer names, but they were names that had
some kind of connection to summer. I even found a way of making Jack
Will's name work by pointing out that you could turn his name into a
sentence about summer, like &quot;Jack will go to the beach,&quot;
which Summer agreed worked fine.</P>

Mom always had this habit of asking me how something felt on a scale
of one to ten. It started after I had my jaw surgery, when I couldn't
talk because my mouth was wired shut. They had taken a piece of bone
from my hip bone to insert into my chin to make it look more normal,
so I was hurting in a lot of different places. Mom would point to one
of my bandages, and I would hold up my fingers to show her how much
it was hurting. One meant a little bit. Ten meant so, so, so much.
Then she would tell the doctor when he made his rounds what needed
adjusting or things like that. Mom got very good at reading my mind
sometimes.</P>

After that, we got into the habit of doing the one-to-ten scale for
anything that hurt, like if I just had a plain old sore throat, she'd
ask: &quot;One to ten?&quot; And I'd say: &quot;Three,&quot; or
whatever it was.</P>

And being at school was awful in the beginning. Every new class I had
was like a new chance for kids to &quot;not stare&quot; at me. They
would sneak peeks at me from behind their notebooks or when they

to avoid bumping into me in any way, like I had some germ they could
catch, like my face was contagious.</P>

surprise some unsuspecting kid who maybe hadn't heard about me. The
kid would make the sound you make when you hold your breath before
going underwater, a little &quot;uh!&quot; sound. This happened maybe
four or five times a day for the first few weeks: on the stairs, in
front of the lockers, in the library. Five hundred kids in a school:
eventually every one of them was going to see my face at some time.</P>

about me, because every once in a while I'd catch a kid elbowing his
friend as they passed me, or talking behind their hands as I walked

I'm not saying they were doing any of these things in a mean way, by
the way: not once did any kid laugh or make noises or do anything
like that. They were just being normal dumb kids. I know that. I kind
of wanted to tell them that. Like, it's okay, I'm know I'm
weird-looking, take a look, I don't bite.  Hey, the truth is, if a
Wookiee started going to the school all of a sudden, I'd be curious,
I'd probably stare a bit! And if I was walking with Jack or Summer,
I'd probably whisper to them: Hey, there's the Wookiee. And if the
Wookiee caught me saying that, he'd know I wasn't trying to be mean.
I was just pointing out the fact that he's a Wookiee.</P>

I hung out with Jack in homeroom, English, history, computer, music,

assigned seats in every class, and I ended up sitting next to Jack in

me and Jack together, or it was a totally incredible coincidence.</P>

took off after his friends. For some reason, me and Jack started

ruined the picture. I was one of the ones in the front, sitting down.

I noticed not too long ago that even though people were getting used
to me, no one would actually touch me. I didn't realize this at first
because it's not like kids go around touching each other that much in
middle school anyway. But last Thursday in dance class, which is,
like, my least favorite class, Mrs. Atanabi, the teacher, tried to
make Ximena Chin be my dance partner. Now, I've never actually seen
someone have a &quot;panic attack&quot; before, but I have heard
about it, and I'm pretty sure Ximena had a panic attack at that
second. She got really nervous and turned pale and literally broke
into a sweat within a minute, and then she came up with some lame
excuse about really having to go to the bathroom. Anyway, Mrs.
Atanabi let her off the hook, because she ended up not making anyone
dance together.</P>

Then yesterday in my science elective, we were doing this cool
mystery-powder investigation where we had to classify a substance as
an acid or a base.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.57in; line-height: 115%">
Everyone had to heat their mystery powders on a heating plate and
make observations, so we were all huddled around the powders with our
notebooks. Now, there are eight kids in the elective, and seven of
them were squished together on one side of the plate while one of
them—me—had loads of room on the other side. So of course I
noticed this, but I was hoping Ms. Rubin wouldn't notice this,
because I didn't want her to say something. But of course she did
notice this, and of course she said something.</P>

been okay-nice to me. I want to go on record as saying that. Not
super-nice, like they go out of their way to hang out with me, but

Rubin told them to come on my side, which a lot of kids do when they
think I'm not looking. Anyway, everything was going fine until
Tristan's mystery powder started melting. He moved his foil off the
plate just as my powder began to melt, too, which is why I went to
move mine off the plate, and then my hand accidentally bumped his
hand for a fraction of a second. Tristan jerked his hand away so fast
he dropped his foil on the floor while also knocking everyone else's
foil off the heating plate.</P>

&quot;Tristan!&quot; yelled Ms. Rubin, but Tristan didn't even care
about the spilled powder on the floor or that he ruined the
experiment. What he was most concerned about was getting to the lab
sink to wash his hands as fast as possible. That's when I knew for
sure that there was this thing about touching me at Beecher Prep.</P>

For me, Halloween is the best holiday in the world. It even beats
Christmas. I get to dress up in a costume. I get to wear  a mask. I
get to go around like every other kid with a mask and nobody thinks I
look weird. Nobody takes a second look. Nobody notices me. Nobody
knows me.</P>

When I was little, I used to wear an astronaut helmet everywhere I
went. To the playground. To the supermarket. To pick Via up from
school. Even in the middle of summer, though it was so hot my face
would sweat. I think I wore it for a couple of years, but I had to
stop wearing it when I had my eye surgery. I was about seven, I
think. And then we couldn't find the helmet after that. Mom looked
everywhere for it. She figured that it had probably ended up in
Grans's attic, and she kept meaning to look for it, but by then I had
gotten used to not wearing it.</P>

This year I'm going to be Boba Fett: not Boba Fett the kid in Star
Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, but Boba Fett the man from
Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back . Mom searched
everywhere for the costume but couldn't find one in my size, so she
bought me a Jango Fett costume—since Jango was Boba's dad and wore
the same armor—and then painted the armor green. She did some other
stuff to it to make it look worn, too. Anyway, it looks totally real.
Mom's good at costumes.</P>

In homeroom we all talked about what we were going to be for
Halloween. Charlotte was going as Hermione from Harry Potter. Jack
was going as a wolfman. I heard that Julian was going as Jango Fett,
which was a weird coincidence. I don't think he liked hearing that I
was going as Boba Fett.</P>

On the morning of Halloween, Via had this big crying meltdown about
something. Via's always been so calm and cool, but this year she's
had a couple of these kinds of fits. Dad was late for work and was
like, &quot;Via, let's go! Let's go!&quot; Usually Dad is super
patient about things, but not when it  comes to his being late for
work, and his yelling just stressed out Via even more, and she
started crying louder, so Mom told Dad to take me to school and that
she'd deal with Via. Then Mom kissed me goodbye quickly, before I
even put on my costume, and disappeared into Via's room.</P>

I rushed to my room and started to put on the Boba Fett costume, but
all of a sudden I didn't feel like wearing it. I'm not sure why—maybe
because it had all these belts that needed to be tightened and I
needed someone's help to put it on. Or maybe it was because it still
smelled a little like paint. All I knew was that it was a lot of work
to put the costume on, and Dad was waiting and would get super
impatient if I made him late. So, at the last minute, I threw on the
Bleeding Scream costume from last year. It was such an easy costume:
just a</P>

Walking through the halls that morning on my way to the lockers was,
I have to say, absolutely awesome. Everything was different now. I
was different. Where I usually walked with my head down, trying to
avoid being seen, today I walked with my head up, looking around. I
wanted to be seen. One kid wearing the same exact costume as mine,
long white skull face oozing fake red blood, high- fived me as we
passed each other on the stairs. I have no idea who he was, and he
had no idea who I was, and I wondered for a second if he would have
ever done that if he'd known it was me under the mask.</P>

I was starting to think this was going to go down as one of the most
awesome days in the history of my life, but then I  got to homeroom.
The first costume I saw as I walked inside the door was Darth
Sidious. It had one of the rubber masks that are so realistic, with a
big black hood over the head and a long black robe. I knew right away
it was Julian, of course. He must have changed his costume at the
last minute because he thought I was coming as Jango Fett. He was
talking to two mummies who must have been Miles and Henry, and they
were all kind of looking at the door like they were waiting for
someone to come through it. I knew it wasn't a Bleeding Scream they
were looking for. It was a Boba Fett.</P>

I was going to go and sit at my usual desk, but for some reason, I

I could hear them talking.</P>

&quot;I don't know,&quot; answered the mummy. &quot;Tushman asked me
to hang out with him at the beginning of the year, and he must have
told all the teachers to put us next to each other in all our
classes, or something.&quot; The mummy shrugged. I knew the shrug, of
course. I knew the voice. I knew I wanted to run out of the class
right then and there. But I stood where I was and listened to Jack
Will finish what he was saying. &quot;I mean, the thing is: he always

I don't know what Jack answered because I walked out of the class
without anyone knowing I had been there. My face felt like it was on
fire while I walked back down the stairs. I was sweating under my
costume. And I started crying. I couldn't keep it from happening. The
tears were so thick in my eyes I could barely see, but I couldn't
wipe them through the mask as I walked. I was looking for a little
tiny spot to disappear into. I wanted a hole I could fall inside of:
a little black hole that would eat me up.</P>

I ended up in the second-floor bathroom. No one was there because
first period had started and everyone was in class. I locked the door

him alive. After you've</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.57in; margin-right: 0.12in; line-height: 115%">
seen someone else going through that, it feels kind of crazy to
complain over not getting the toy you  had asked for, or your mom
missing a school play. I knew this even when I was six years old. No
one ever told it to me. I just knew it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.57in; margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
So I've gotten used to not complaining, and I've gotten used to not
bothering Mom and Dad with little stuff. I've gotten used to figuring
things out on my own: how to put toys together, how to organize my
life so I don't miss friends' birthday parties, how to stay on top of
my schoolwork so I never fall behind in class. I've never asked for
help with my homework. Never needed reminding to finish a project or
study for a test. If I was having trouble with a subject in school,
I'd go home and study it until I figured it out on my own. I taught
myself how to convert fractions into decimal  points by going online.
I've done every school project pretty much by myself. When Mom or Dad
ask me how things are going in school, I've always said &quot;good&quot;—even
when it hasn't always been so good. My worst day, worst fall, worst
headache, worst bruise, worst cramp, worst mean thing anyone could
say has always been nothing compared to what August has gone through.
This isn't me being noble, by the way: it's just the way I know it
is.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.57in; margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">

of us. But this year there seems to be a shift in the cosmos. The

I honestly don't remember my life before August came into it. I look
at pictures of me as a baby, and I see Mom and Dad smiling so
happily, holding me. I can't believe how much younger they looked
back then: Dad was this hipster dude and Mom was this cute Brazilian
fashionista. There's one shot of me at my third birthday: Dad's right
behind me while Mom's holding the cake with three lit candles, and in
back of us are Tata and Poppa, Grans, Uncle Ben, Aunt Kate, and Uncle
Po. Everyone's looking at me and I'm looking at the cake. You can see
in that picture how I really was the first child, first grandchild,
first niece. I don't remember what it felt like, of course, but I can
see it plain as can be in the pictures.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.57in; margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
I don't remember the day they brought August home from the hospital.
I don't remember what I said or did or felt when I saw him for the
first time, though everyone has a story about it. Apparently, I just
looked at him for a long time without saying anything at all, and
then finally I said: &quot;It doesn't look like Lilly!&quot; That was
the name of a doll Grans had given me when Mom was pregnant so I</P>

could &quot;practice&quot; being a big sister. It was one of those
dolls that are incredibly lifelike, and I had carried it everywhere
for months, changing its diaper, feeding it. I'm told I even made a
baby sling for it. The story goes that after my initial reaction to
August, it only took a few minutes (according to Grans) or a few days
(according to Mom) before I was all over him: kissing him, cuddling
him, baby talking to him. After that I never so much as touched or
mentioned Lilly ever again.</P>

I never used to see August the way other people saw him. I knew he
didn't look exactly normal, but I really didn't understand why
strangers seemed so shocked when they saw him. Horrified. Sickened.
Scared. There are so many words I can use to describe the looks on
people's faces. And for a long time I didn't get it. I'd just get
mad. Mad when they stared. Mad when they looked away. &quot;What the
heck are you looking at?&quot; I'd say to people—even grown-ups.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.57in; margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Then, when I was about eleven, I went to stay with Grans in Montauk
for four weeks while August was having his big  jaw surgery. This was
the longest I'd ever been away from home, and I have to say it was so
amazing to suddenly be free of all that stuff that made me so mad. No
one stared at Grans and me when we went to town to buy groceries. No
one pointed at us. No one even noticed us.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.57in; margin-right: 0.12in; text-indent: 0.05in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Grans was one of those grandmothers who do everything with their
grandkids. She'd run into the ocean if I asked her to, even if she
had nice clothes on. She would let me play with her makeup and didn't
mind if I used it on her face to practice my face-painting skills.
She'd take me for ice cream even if we hadn't eaten dinner yet. She'd
draw chalk horses on the sidewalk in front of her house. One night,
while we were walking back from town, I told her that I wished I
could live with her forever. I was so happy there. I think it might
have been the best time in my life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.57in; margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Coming home after four weeks felt very strange at first. I remember
very vividly stepping through the door and seeing August running over
to welcome me home, and for this tiny fraction of a moment I saw him
not the way I've always seen him, but the way other people see him.
It was only a flash, an instant while he was hugging me, so happy
that I was home, but it surprised me because I'd never seen him like
that before. And I'd never felt what I was feeling before, either: a
feeling I hated myself for having the moment I had it. But as he was
kissing me with all his heart, all I could see was the drool coming
down his chin. And suddenly there I was, like all those people who
would stare or look away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.62in; margin-top: 0.14in">

Thankfully, that only lasted for a second: the moment I heard August
laugh his raspy little laugh, it was over. Everything was back the
way it had been before. But it had opened a door for me. A little
peephole. And on the other side of the peephole there were two
Augusts: the one I saw blindly, and the one other people saw.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.57in; margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
I think the only person in the world I could have told any of this to
was Grans, but I didn't. It was too hard to explain over the phone. I
thought maybe when she came for Thanksgiving, I'd tell her what I
felt. But just two months after I stayed with her in Montauk, my
beautiful Grans died. It was so completely out of the blue.
Apparently, she had checked herself into the hospital because she'd
been feeling  nauseous. Mom and I drove out to see her, but it's a
threehour  drive from where we live, and by the time we got to the
hospital, Grans was gone. A heart attack, they told us. Just like
that.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.57in; margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
It's so strange how one day you can be on this earth, and the next
day not. Where did she go? Will I really ever see her again, or is
that a fairy tale?</P>

You see movies and TV shows where people receive horrible news in
hospitals, but for us, with all our many trips to the hospital with
August, there had always been good outcomes. What I remember the most
from the day Grans died is Mom literally crumpling to the floor in
slow, heaving sobs, holding her stomach like someone had just punched
her. I've never, ever seen Mom like that. Never heard sounds like
that come out of her. Even through all of August's surgeries, Mom
always put on a brave face.</P>

On my last day in Montauk, Grans and I had watched the sun set on the
beach. We had taken a blanket to sit on, but it had gotten chilly, so
we wrapped it around us and cuddled and talked until there wasn't
even a sliver of sun left over the ocean. And then Grans told me she
had a secret to tell me: she loved me more than anyone else in the
world.</P>

His eyes are about an inch below where they should be on his face,
almost to halfway down his cheeks. They slant downward at an extreme
angle, almost like diagonal slits that someone cut into his face, and
the left one is noticeably lower than the right one. They bulge
outward because his eye cavities are too shallow to accommodate them.
The top eyelids are always halfway closed, like he's on the verge of
sleeping. The lower eyelids sag so much they almost look like a piece
of invisible string is pulling them downward: you can see the red
part on the inside, like they're almost inside out. He doesn't have
eyebrows or eyelashes. His nose is disproportionately big for his
face, and kind of fleshy. His head is pinched in on the sides where
the ears should be, like someone used giant pliers and crushed the
middle part of his face. He doesn't have cheekbones. There are deep
creases running down both sides of his nose to his mouth, which gives
him a waxy appearance. Sometimes people assume he's been burned in a
fire: his features look like they've been melted, like the drippings
on the side of a candle. Several surgeries to correct his palate have
left a few scars around his mouth, the most noticeable one being a
jagged gash running from the middle of his upper lip to his nose. His
upper teeth are small and splay out. He has a severe overbite and an
extremely undersized jawbone. He has a very small chin. When he was
very little, before a piece of his hip bone was surgically implanted
into his lower jaw, he really had no chin at all. His tongue would
just hang out of his mouth with nothing underneath to block it.</P>

He can eat, at least: when he was younger, he had a feeding tube. And
he can talk. And he's learned to keep his tongue inside his mouth,
though that took him several years to master. He's also learned to
control the drool that used to run down his neck. These are
considered miracles. When he was a baby, the doctors didn't think
he'd live.</P>

Then again, I'm not really sure what August knows or doesn't know,
what he understands and doesn't understand. Does August see how other
people see him, or has he gotten  so good at pretending not to see
that it doesn't bother him? Or does it bother him? When he looks in
the mirror, does he  see the Auggie Mom and Dad see, or does he see
the Auggie everyone else sees? Or is there another August he sees,
someone in his dreams behind the misshapen head and face? Sometimes
when I looked at Grans, I could see the pretty girl she used to be
underneath the wrinkles. I could see the girl from Ipanema inside the
old-lady walk. Does August see himself as he might have looked
without that single gene that caused the catastrophe of his face?</P>

I wish I could ask him this stuff. I wish he would tell me how he
feels. He used to be easier to read before the surgeries. You knew
that when his eyes squinted, he was happy. When his mouth went
straight, he was being mischievous. When his cheeks trembled, he was
about to cry. He looks better now, no doubt about that, but the signs
we used to gauge his moods are all gone. There are new ones, of
course. Mom and Dad can read every single one. But I'm having trouble
keeping up. And there's a part of me that doesn't want to keep
trying: why can't he just say what he's feeling like everyone else?
He doesn't have a trache tube in his mouth anymore that keeps him
from talking. His jaw's not wired shut. He's ten years old. He can
use his words. But we circle around him like he's still the baby he
used to be. We change plans, go to plan B, interrupt conversations,
go back on promises depending on his moods, his whims, his needs.
That was fine when he was little. But he needs to grow up now. We
need to let him, help him, make him grow up. Here's what I think:
we've all spent so much time trying to make August think he's normal
that he actually thinks he is normal. And the problem is, he's not.</P>

and different from home. I could go there and be Olivia Pullman—not
Via, which is my name at home. Via was what they called me in
elementary school, too. Back then, everyone knew all about us, of
course. Mom used to pick me up after school, and August was always in
the stroller. There weren't a lot of people who were equipped to
babysit for Auggie, so Mom and Dad brought him to all my class plays
and concerts and recitals, all the school functions, the bake sales
and the book fairs. My friends knew him. My friends' parents knew
him. My</P>

They've known August since he was a little baby. When we were little,
our favorite thing to do was play dress up with Auggie; load him up
with feather boas and big hats and Hannah Montana wigs. He used to
love it, of course, and we thought he was adorably cute in his own
way. Ella said he reminded her of E.T. She didn't say this to be
mean, of course (though maybe it was a little bit mean). The truth
is, there's a scene in the movie when Drew Barrymore dresses E.T. in
a blond wig: and that was a ringer for Auggie in our Miley Cyrus

Throughout middle school, Miranda, Ella, and I were pretty much our

brainy, not jocks, not rich, not druggies, not mean, not goody-goody,
not huge, not flat. I don't know if the three of us found each other
because we were so alike in so many ways, or that because we found
each other, we've become so alike in so many ways. We were so happy
when we all got into Faulkner High School. It was such a long shot

Out of the three of us, Miranda had almost always been the sweetest
to August, hugging him and playing with him long after Ella and I had
moved on to playing something else. Even as we got older, Miranda
always made sure to try to include August in our conversations, ask
him how he was doing, talk to him about Avatar or Star Wars or Bone
or something she knew he liked. It was Miranda who had given Auggie
the astronaut helmet he wore practically every day of the year when
he was five or six. She would call him Major Tom and they would sing
&quot;Space Oddity&quot; by David Bowie together. It was their little
thing. They knew all the words and would blast it on the iPod and
sing the song out loud.</P>

Since Miranda's always been really good about calling us as soon as
she got home from summer camp, I was a little surprised when I didn't
hear from her. I even texted her and she didn't reply. I figured
maybe she had ended up staying in the camp longer, now that she was a
counselor. Maybe she met a cute guy.</P>

Then I realized from her Facebook wall that she'd actually been back
home for a full two weeks, so I sent her an IM and we chatted online
a bit, but she didn't give me a reason for not calling, which I
thought was bizarre. Miranda had always been a little flaky, so I
figured that's all it was. We made plans to meet downtown, but then I
had to cancel because we were driving out to visit Tata and Poppa for
the weekend.</P>

So I ended up not seeing either Miranda or Ella until the first day
of school. And, I have to admit, I was shocked. Miranda looked so
different: her hair was cut in this super-cute bob that she'd dyed
bright pink, of all things, and she was wearing a striped tube top
that (a) seemed way inappropriate for school, and (b) was totally not
her usual style. Miranda had always been such a prude about clothes,
and here she was all pink-haired and tube-topped. But it wasn't just
the way she looked that was different: she was acting differently,
too. I can't say she wasn't nice, because she was, but she seemed
kind of distant, like I was a casual friend. It was the weirdest
thing in the world.</P>

At lunch the three of us sat together like we always used to, but the
dynamics had shifted. It was obvious to me that Ella and Miranda had
gotten together a few times during the summer without me, though they
never actually said that. I pretended not to be at all upset while we
talked, though I could feel my face getting hot, my smile being fake.
Although Ella wasn't as over-the-top as Miranda, I noticed a change
in her usual style, too. It's like they had talked to each other
beforehand about redoing their image at the new school, but hadn't</P>

the new Miranda. After school I ducked into a restroom to avoid

I'm not sure at what point that night Auggie had cut off his Padawan
braid, or why that made me really mad. I had always found his
obsession with everything Star Wars kind of geeky, and that braid in
the back of his hair, with its little beads, was just awful. But he
had always been so proud of it, of how long it took him to grow it,
of how he had chosen the beads himself in a crafts store in Soho. He
and Christopher, his best friend, used to play with lightsabers and
Star Wars</P>

stuff whenever they got together, and they had both started growing
their braids at the same time. When August cut his braid off that
night, without an explanation, without telling me beforehand (which
was surprising)—or even calling Christopher—I was just so upset I

I've seen Auggie brushing his hair in the bathroom mirror. He

But she didn't come back that night. Dad did. He told me Auggie had
had a bad first day and Mom was helping him through it. He asked me
how my day had gone and I told him fine. He said he didn't believe me
for a second, and I told him Miranda and Ella were acting like jerks.
(I didn't mention how I took the subway home by myself, though.) He
said nothing tests friendships like high school, and then proceeded
to poke fun at the fact that I was reading <I>War and Peace</I>. Not
real fun, of course, since I'd heard him brag to people that he had a
&quot;fifteen-year-old who is reading Tolstoy.&quot; But he liked to
rib me about where I was in the book, in a war part or in a peace
part, and if there was anything in there about Napoleon's days as a
hip-hop dancer. It was silly stuff, but Dad always managed to make
everyone laugh. And sometimes that's all you need to feel better.</P>

Once, I got up in the middle of the night because I was thirsty, and
I saw Mom standing outside Auggie's room. Her hand was on the
doorknob, her forehead leaning on the door, which was ajar. She
wasn't going in his room or stepping out: just standing right outside
the door, as if she was listening to the sound of his breathing as he
slept. The hallway lights were out. The only thing illuminating her
was the blue nightlight in August's bedroom. She looked ghostlike
standing there. Or maybe I should say angelic. I tried to walk back
into my room without disturbing her, but she heard me and walked over
to me.</P>

walked me back into my room, pulled the covers over me, and kissed me
good night. She never explained what she was doing outside his door,

Mom's side of the family is from Brazil. Except for her mother, my
beautiful Grans, and her dad, Agosto, who died before I was born, the
rest of Mom's family—all her glamorous aunts, uncles, and
cousins—still live in Alto Leblon, a ritzy suburb south of Rio.
Grans and Agosto moved to Boston in the early sixties, and had Mom
and Aunt Kate, who's married to Uncle Porter.</P>

Mom and Dad met at Brown University and have been together ever
since. Isabel and Nate: like two peas in a pod. They moved to New

of upper <I>upper </I>Manhattan, when I was about a year old.</P>

Not one person in the exotic mix of my family gene pool has ever
shown any obvious signs of having what August has.  I've pored over
grainy sepia pictures of long-dead relatives in babushkas;
black-and-white snapshots of distant cousins in crisp white linen
suits, soldiers in uniform, ladies with  beehive hairdos; Polaroids
of bell-bottomed teenagers and long-haired hippies, and not once have
I been able to detect even the slightest trace of August's face in
their faces. Not a one. But after August was born, my parents
underwent genetic counseling. They were told that August had what
seemed to be a &quot;previously unknown type of mandibulofacial
dysostosis caused by an autosomal recessive mutation in the TCOF1
gene, which is located on chromosome 5, complicated by a hemifacial
microsomia characteristic of OAV spectrum.&quot; Sometimes these
mutations occur during pregnancy. Sometimes they're inherited from
one parent carrying the dominant gene. Sometimes they're caused by
the interaction of many genes, possibly in combination with
environmental factors. This is called multifactorial inheritance. In
August's case, the doctors were able to identify one of the &quot;single
nucleotide deletion mutations&quot; that made war on his face. The
weird thing is, though you'd never know it from looking at them: both
my parents carry that mutant gene.</P>

If I have children, there's a one-in-two chance that I will pass on
the defective gene to them. That doesn't mean they'll look like
August, but they'll carry the gene that got doubledosed in August and
helped make him the way he is. If I marry someone who has the same
defective gene, there's a one-in-two chance that our kids will carry
the gene and look totally normal, a one-in-four chance that our kids
will not carry the gene at all, and a one-in-four chance that our
kids will look like August.</P>

If August has children with someone who doesn't have a trace of the
gene, there's a 100 percent probability that their kids will inherit
the gene, but a zero percent chance that their kids will have a
double dose of it, like August. Which means they'll carry the gene no
matter what, but they could look totally normal. If he marries
someone who has the gene, their kids will have the same odds as my
kids.</P>

that other part of his genetic makeup that's not inherited but just
incredibly bad luck.</P>

Countless doctors have drawn little tic-tac-toe grids for my parents
over the years to try to explain the genetic lottery to them.
Geneticists use these Punnett squares to determine inheritance,
recessive and dominant genes, probabilities and chance. But for all
they know, there's more they don't know. They can try to forecast the
odds, but they can't guarantee them. They use terms like &quot;germline
mosaicism,&quot; &quot;chromosome rearrangement,&quot; or &quot;delayed
mutation&quot; to  explain why their science is not an exact science.
I actually like how doctors talk. I like the sound of science. I like
how words you don't understand explain things you can't understand.
There are countless people under words like &quot;germline
mosaicism,&quot; &quot;chromosome rearrangement,&quot; or &quot;delayed
mutation.&quot; Countless babies who'll never be born, like mine.</P>

I ended up hanging out with a girl named Eleanor who I'd known from
my days at PS 22, though we'd gone to different middle schools.
Eleanor had always been a really smart girl —a little bit of a
crybaby back then, but nice. I'd never realized how funny she was
(not laugh-out-loud Daddyfunny, but full of great quips), and she
never knew how lighthearted I could be. Eleanor, I guess, had always
been under the impression that I was very serious. And, as it turns
out, she'd never liked Miranda and Ella. She thought they were
stuck-up.</P>

I gained entry through Eleanor to the smart-kids' table at lunch. It
was a larger group than I'd been accustomed to hanging out with, and
a more diverse crowd. It included Eleanor's boyfriend, Kevin, who
would definitely become class president someday; a few techie guys;
girls like Eleanor who were members of the yearbook committee and the
debate club; and a quiet guy named Justin who had small round glasses
and played the violin, and who I had an instant crush on.</P>

Miranda, but because August was in his own world these days. There

Grans had died the night before Halloween. Since then, even though
it's been four years, this has always been a sad time of year for me.
For Mom, too, though she doesn't always say it. Instead, she immerses
herself in getting August's costume ready, since we all know
Halloween is his favorite time of year.</P>

This year was no different. August really wanted to be a <I>Star Wars

in August's size, which, strangely enough, was out of stock
everywhere. She went to every online store, found a few on eBay that
were going for an outrageous amount, and</P>

finally ended up buying a Jango Fett costume that she then converted
into a Boba Fett costume by painting it green. I would say, in all,
she must have spent two weeks working on the stupid costume. And no,
I won't mention the fact that Mom has never made any of my costumes,
because it really has no bearing on anything at all.</P>

The morning of Halloween I woke up thinking about Grans, which made
me really sad and weepy. Dad kept telling me to hurry up and get
dressed, which just stressed me out even more, and suddenly I started
crying. I just wanted to stay home.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.57in; margin-right: 0.11in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
So Dad took August to school that morning and Mom said I could stay
home, and the two of us cried together for a while. One thing I knew
for sure: however much I missed Grans, Mom must have missed her more.
All those times August was clinging to life after a surgery, all
those rush trips to the ER: Grans had always been there for Mom. It
felt good to cry with Mom. For both of us. At some point, Mom had the
idea of our watching <I>The Ghost and Mrs. Muir </I>together, which
was one of our all-time favorite black-and white movies. I agreed
that that was a great idea. I think I probably would have used this
weeping session as an opportunity to tell Mom everything that was
going on at school with Miranda and Ella, but just as we were sitting
down in front of the DVD player, the phone rang. It was the nurse
from August's school calling to tell Mom that August had a stomach
ache and should be picked up. So much for the old movies and the
mother-daughter bonding.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.57in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Mom picked August up, and the moment he came home, he went straight
to the bathroom and threw up. Then he went to his bed and pulled the
covers over his head. Mom took his temperature, brought him some hot
tea, and assumed the &quot;August's mom&quot; role again. &quot;Via's
mom,&quot; who had come out for a little while, was put away. I
understood, though: August was in bad shape.</P>

Neither one of us asked him why he had worn his Bleeding Scream

him. If it annoyed Mom to see the costume she had worked on for two
weeks tossed on the floor, unused, she didn't show it.</P>

August said he wasn't feeling well enough to go trick-or-treating
later in the afternoon, which was sad for him because I know how much
he loved to trick-or- treat— especially after it got dark outside.
Even though I was well beyond the trick-or-treating stage myself, I
usually threw on some mask or other to accompany him up and down the
blocks, watching him knocking on people's doors, giddy with
excitement. I knew it was the one night a year when he could truly be
like every other kid. No one knew he was different under the mask. To
August, that must have felt absolutely amazing.</P>

This surprised me. Usually August was such a trouper about his
medical issues, whether it was skateboarding a few days after a
surgery or sipping food through a straw when his mouth was

taken more medicines, put up with more procedures by the age of ten

was sidelined from a little nausea?</P>

&quot;Do people go out of their way to avoid touching you, Via?&quot;
he answered, which left me momentarily without an answer. &quot;Yeah,
right. That's what I thought. So don't compare your bad days at

&quot;Okay, that's fair,&quot; I said. &quot;But it's not a contest
about whose days suck the most, Auggie. The point is we all have to
put up with the bad days. Now, unless you want to be treated like a

just have to suck it up and go.&quot;</P>

I sat with him that first day because I felt sorry for him. That's

one was talking to him. Everyone was staring at him. All the girls at

Beecher Prep, but he was the only one everyone was talking about.
Julian had nicknamed him the Zombie Kid, and that's what everyone was
calling him. &quot;Did you see the Zombie Kid yet?&quot; Stuff like
that gets around fast. And August knew it. It's hard enough being the

One of the things I'm not loving about this year is how a lot of the
kids are acting like they're too grown-up to play things anymore. All
they want to do is &quot;hang out&quot; and &quot;talk&quot; at
recess. And all they talk about now is who likes who and who is cute
and isn't cute. August doesn't bother about that stuff. He likes to
play Four Square at recess, which I love to play, too.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
It was actually because I was playing Four Square with August that I
found out about the Plague. Apparently this is a &quot;game&quot;
that's been going on since the beginning of the year. Anyone who
accidentally touches August has only thirty seconds to wash their
hands or find hand sanitizer before they catch the Plague. I'm not
sure what happens to you if you actually catch the Plague because
nobody's  touched August yet—not directly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
How I found out about this is that Maya Markowitz told me that the
reason she won't play Four Square with us at recess is that she
doesn't want to catch the Plague. I was like, &quot;What's the
Plague?&quot; And she told me. I told Maya I thought that was really
dumb and she agreed, but she still wouldn't touch a ball that August
just touched, not if she could help it.</P>

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.17in; line-height: 115%">
Savanna is probably the most popular girl in the school. All the boys
like her. All the girls want to be friends with her. She was the
first girl in the grade to actually have a &quot;boyfriend.&quot; It
was some kid who goes to MS 281, though she dumped him and started
dating Henry Joplin, which makes sense because the two of them
totally look like teenagers already.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.17in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Anyway, even though I'm not in the &quot;popular&quot; group, I
somehow got invited, which is very cool. When I told  Savanna I got
her invitation and would be going to her party, she was really nice
to me, though she made sure to tell me that she didn't invite a lot
of people, so I shouldn't go around bragging to anyone that I got
invited. Maya didn't get invited, for instance. Savanna also made
sure to tell me not to wear a costume. It's good she told me because,
of course, I would have worn a costume to a Halloween party—not the
unicorn costume I made for the Halloween Parade, but the Goth girl
getup that I'd worn to school. But even that was a no-no for
Savanna's party. The only negative about my going to Savanna's party
was that now I wouldn't be able to go the parade and the unicorn
costume would be wasted. That was kind of a bummer, but okay.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">

hello), and threw my jacket on a coatrack in her hallway. Then she
took me by the hand down the stairs to her basement, which is where
the party was. I didn't see her parents anywhere.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
There were about fifteen kids there: all of them were popular kids
from either Savanna's group or Julian's group. I guess they've all
kind of merged into one big supergroup of popular kids, now that some
of them have started dating each other.</P>

standing next to me, literally hovering over me.</P>

actually looked away because between the way he was chewing, which
almost seemed like he was being gross on purpose, and the way his

from him.</P>

Everyone in the grade got assigned an Egyptian artifact to work on

The Egyptian Tomb</H2>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; line-height: 115%">
Over the next month, August and I hung out a lot after school, either
at his house or my house. August's parents even invited Mom and me
over for dinner a couple of times. I overheard them talking about
fixing Mom up on a blind date with August's uncle Ben.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: always">
On the day of the Egyptian Museum exhibit, we were all really excited
and kind of giddy. It had snowed the day before—not as much as it
had snowed over the Thanksgiving break, but still, snow is snow.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
The gym was turned into a giant museum, with everyone's Egyptian
artifact displayed on a table with a little caption card explaining
what the thing was. Most of the artifacts were really great, but I
have to say I really think mine and August's were the best. My
sculpture of Anubis looked pretty real, and I had even used real gold
paint on it. And August had made his step pyramid out of sugar cubes.
It was two feet high and two feet long, and he had spray painted the
cubes with this kind of fake-sand paint or something. It looked so
awesome.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
We all dressed up in Egyptian costumes. Some of the kids were Indiana
Jones-type archaeologists. Some of them dressed up like pharaohs.
August and I dressed up like mummies. Our faces were covered except
for two little holes for the eyes and one little hole for the mouth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
When the parents showed up, they all lined up in the hallway in front
of the gym. Then we were told we could go get our parents, and each
kid got to take his or her parent on a flashlight tour through the
dark gym. August and I took our moms around together.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.14in; margin-top: 0in; line-height: 115%">
We stopped at each exhibit, explaining what it was, talking in
whispers, answering questions. Since it was dark, we used our
flashlights to illuminate the artifacts while we were talking.
Sometimes, for dramatic effect, we would hold the flashlights under
our chins while we were explaining something in detail. It was so
much fun, hearing all these whispers in the dark, seeing all the
lights zigzagging around the dark room.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
At one point, I went over to get a drink at the water fountain. I had
to take the mummy wrap off my face.</P>

The Call</H2>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.17in; line-height: 115%">
So in August my parents got this call from Mr. Tushman, the
middle-school director. And my Mom said: &quot;Maybe he calls all the
new students to welcome them,&quot; and my dad said:  &quot;That's a
lot of kids he'd be calling.&quot; So my mom called him  back, and I
could hear her talking to Mr. Tushman on the phone. This is exactly
what she said:</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 113%; page-break-before: always">
&quot;Oh, hi, Mr. Tushman. This is Amanda Will, returning your call?
Pause. Oh, thank you! That's so nice of you to say. He is looking
forward to it. <I>Pause. </I>Yes. <I>Pause. </I>Yeah.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.26in; margin-top: 0in; line-height: 115%">
<I>Pause. </I>Oh. Sure. <I>Long pause</I>. Ohhh. Uh-huh. <I>Pause</I>.
Well, that's so nice of you to say. <I>Pause</I>. Sure. Ohh. Wow.
Ohhhh. <I>Super long pause</I>. I see, of course. I'm sure he will.
Let me write it down . . . got it. I'll call you after I've had a
chance to talk to him, okay? <I>Pause</I>. No, thank you for thinking
of him. Bye bye!&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">And when
she hung up, I was like, &quot;what's up, what did he say?&quot;</P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; line-height: 115%">
And Mom said: &quot;Well, it's actually very flattering but kind of
sad, too. See, there's this boy who's starting middle school this
year, and he's never been in a real school environment  before
because he was homeschooled, so Mr. Tushman  talked to some of the
lower-school teachers to find out who they thought were some of the
really, really great kids coming into fifth grade, and the teachers
must have told him you were an especially nice kid—which I already
knew, of course—and so Mr. Tushman is wondering if he could count
on you to sort of shepherd this new boy around a bit?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.16in; margin-top: 0.14in">
&quot;Like let him hang out with me?&quot; I said.</P>

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 1.88in; line-height: 186%">
&quot;Exactly,&quot; said Mom. &quot;He called it being a 'welcome
buddy.' &quot; &quot;But why me?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;I told you. Your teachers told Mr. Tushman that you were the
kind of kid who's known for being a good egg. I mean, I'm so proud
that they think so highly of you. . . .&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 4.97in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 186%">
&quot;Why is it sad?&quot; &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</P>

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Oh.&quot; Mom nodded. &quot;Well, apparently this boy has some
sort of . . . um, I guess there's something wrong with his face . . .
or something like that. Not sure. Maybe he was in an accident. Mr.
Tushman said he'd explain a bit more when you come to the school next
week.&quot;</P>

&quot;Well, I'm not going to force you,&quot; she said, &quot;but at

back until tomorrow, so just sit with it a bit. I mean, Jack, I
really don't think it's that much to ask that you spend a little
extra time with some new kid. . . .&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 1.43in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 187%">
&quot;It's not just that he's a new kid, Mom,&quot; I answered. &quot;He's
deformed.&quot; &quot;That's a terrible thing to say, Jack.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 0.19in">&quot;He

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.11in; margin-top: 0.17in; line-height: 115%">
I remember seeing him for the first time in front of the Carvel on
Amesfort Avenue when I was about five or six. Me and Veronica, my
babysitter, were sitting on the bench outside the store with Jamie,
my baby brother, who was sitting in his stroller facing us. I guess I
was busy eating my ice cream cone, because I didn't even notice the
people who sat down next to us.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; text-indent: 0.05in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Then at one point I turned my head to suck the ice cream out of the
bottom of my cone, and that's when I saw him: August. He was sitting
right next to me. I know it wasn't cool, but I kind of went &quot;Uhh!&quot;
when I saw him because I honestly got scared. I thought he was
wearing a zombie mask or something. It was the kind of &quot;uhh&quot;
you say when you're watching a scary movie and the bad guy like jumps
out of the bushes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; line-height: 115%">
Anyway, I know it wasn't nice of me to do that, and though the kid
didn't hear me, I know his sister did.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Jack! We have to go!&quot; said Veronica. She had gotten up and
was turning the stroller around because Jamie, who had obviously just
noticed the kid, too, was about to say something embarrassing. So I
jumped up kind of suddenly, like a bee had landed on me, and followed
Veronica as she zoomed away. I could hear the kid's mom saying softly
behind us: &quot;Okay, guys, I think it's time to go,&quot; and I
turned around to look at</P>

them one more time. The kid was licking his ice cream cone, the mom
was picking up his scooter, and the sister was glaring at me like she
was going to kill me. I looked away quickly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;Veronica,
what was wrong with that kid?&quot; I whispered.</P>

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Hush, boy!&quot; she said, her voice angry. I love Veronica,
but when she got mad, she got <I>mad</I>. Meanwhile, Jamie was
practically spilling out of his stroller trying to get another look
as Veronica pushed him away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;But,

&quot;It was bad how we did that,&quot; she said. &quot;Just getting

That was the first time I ever saw August in the neighborhood, at
least that I remember. But I've seen him around ever since then: a
couple of times in the playground, a few times in the park. He used
to wear an astronaut helmet  sometimes. But I always knew it was him
underneath the helmet. All the kids in the neighborhood knew it was
him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 115%">Everyone
has seen August at some point or another. We all know his name,

August going 'Ahhh,' I suddenly felt really bad. The thing is, there
are always going to be kids like Julian who are jerks. But if a
little kid like Jamie, who's usually a nice enough kid, can be that

Second of all, he's actually a really cool dude. I mean, he's pretty

something funny to me that no one else hears and totally make me
crack up. He's also just, overall, a nice kid. Like, he's easy to
hang out with and talk to and stuff. T</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.14in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
hird of all, he's really smart. I thought he'd be behind everyone
because he hadn't gone to school before. But in most things he's way
ahead of me. I mean, maybe not as smart as Charlotte or Ximena, but
he's up there. And unlike Charlotte or Ximena, he lets me cheat off
of him if I really need to (though I've only needed to a couple of
times). He also let me copy his homework once, though we both got in
trouble for it after class.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.09in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;The two of you got the exact same answers wrong on yesterday's
homework,&quot; Ms. Rubin said, looking at both of us like she was
waiting for an explanation. I didn't know what to say, because the
explanation would have been: Oh, that's because I copied August's
homework.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: always">
But August lied to protect me. He was like, &quot;Oh, that's because
we did our homework together last night,&quot; which wasn't true at
all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Well, doing homework together is a good thing,&quot; Ms. Rubin
answered, &quot;but you're supposed to still do it separately, okay?
You could work side by side if you want, but you can't actually do
your homework together, okay? Got it?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
After we left the classroom, I said: &quot;Dude, thanks for doing
that.&quot; And he was like, &quot;No problem.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">That was

Fourthly, now that I know him, I would say I actually do want to be
friends with August. At first, I admit it, I was only friendly to him
because Mr. Tushman asked me to be especially nice and all that. But
now I would choose to hang out with him. He laughs at all my jokes.
And I kind of feel like I can tell August anything. Like he's a good
friend.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0in; line-height: 115%">
Like, if all the guys in the fifth grade were lined up against a wall

August.</P>

Bleeding Scream? What the heck? Summer Dawson has always been a bit
out there, but this was too much. All I did was ask her why August
was acting like he was mad at me or something. I figured she would
know. And all she said was &quot;Bleeding Scream&quot;? I don't even
know what that means.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.14in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
It's so weird because one day, me and August were friends. And the
next day, whoosh, he was hardly talking to me. And I haven't the
slightest idea why. When I said to him, &quot;Hey, August, you mad at
me or something?&quot; he shrugged and walked away. So I would take
that as a definite yes. And since I know for a fact that I didn't do
anything to him to be mad about, I figured Summer could tell me
what's up. But all I got from her was &quot;Bleeding Scream&quot;?
Yeah, big help. Thanks, Summer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
You know, I've got plenty of other friends in school. So if August
wants to officially be my ex-friend, then fine, that is okay by me,
see if I care. I've started ignoring him like he's ignoring me in
school now. This is actually kind of hard since we sit next to each
other in practically every class.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; text-indent: 0.05in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Other kids have noticed and have started asking if me and August have
had a fight. Nobody asks August what's going on. Hardly anyone ever
talks to him, anyway. I mean, the only person he hangs out with,
other than me, is Summer. Sometimes he hangs out with Reid Kingsley a
little bit, and the two Maxes got him playing Dungeons</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: always">
&amp; Dragons a couple of times at recess. Charlotte, for all her
Goody Two- Shoeing, doesn't ever do more than nod hello when she's
passing him in the hallway. And I don't know if everyone's still
playing the Plague behind his back, because no one ever really told
me about it directly, but my point is that it's not like he has a
whole lot of other friends he could be hanging out with instead of
me. If he wants to dis me, he's the one who loses—not me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.12in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
So this is how things are between us now. We only talk to each other
about school stuff if we absolutely have to. Like, I'll say, &quot;What
did Rubin say the homework was?&quot; and he'll answer. Or he'll be
like, &quot;Can I use your pencil sharpener?&quot; and I'll get my
sharpener out of my pencil case for him. But as soon as the bell
rings, we go our separate ways.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.17in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Why this is good is because I get to hang out with a lot more kids
now. Before, when I was hanging out with August all the time, kids
weren't hanging out with me because they'd have to hang out with him.
Or they would keep things from me, like the whole thing about the
Plague. I think I was the only one who wasn't in on it, except for
Summer and maybe the D&amp;D crowd. And the truth is, though nobody's
that obvious about it: nobody wants to hang out with him. Everyone's
way too hung up on being in the popular group, and he's just as far
from the popular group as you can get.  But now I can hang out with
anyone I want. If I wanted to be in the popular group, I could
totally be in the popular group.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Why this is bad is because, well, (a) I don't actually enjoy hanging
out with the popular group that much. And (b) I actually liked
hanging out with August. So this is kind of messed up. And it's all
August's fault.</P>

Snow</H2>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.22in; margin-top: 0.17in; line-height: 115%">
The first snow of winter hit right before Thanksgiving break. School
was closed, so we got an extra day of vacation. I was glad about that
because I was so bummed about this whole August thing and I just
wanted some time to chill without having to see him every day. Also,
waking up to a snow day is just about my favorite thing in the world.
I love that feeling when you first open your eyes in the morning and
you don't even know why everything seems different than usual. Then
it hits you: Everything is quiet. No cars honking. No buses going
down the street. Then you run over to the window, and outside
everything is covered in white: the sidewalks, the trees, the cars on
the street, your windowpanes. And when that happens on a school day
and you find out your school is closed, well, I don't care how old I
get: I'm always going to think that that's the best feeling in the
world. And I'm never going to be one of those grown-ups that use an
umbrella when it's snowing—ever.</P>

Dad's school was closed, too, so he took me and Jamie sledding down
Skeleton Hill in the park. They say a little kid broke his neck while
sledding down that hill a few years ago, but I don't know if this is
actually true or just one of those legends. On the way home, I
spotted this banged-up wooden sled kind of propped up against the Old
Indian Rock monument. Dad said to leave it, it was just garbage, but
something told me it would make the greatest sled ever. So Dad let me
drag it home, and I spent the rest of the day fixing it up. I
super-glued the broken slats together and wrapped some heavy- duty
white duct tape around them for extra strength. Then I spray painted
the whole thing white with the paint I had gotten for the Alabaster
Sphinx I was making for the Egyptian Museum project. When it was all
dry, I painted LIGHTNING in gold letters on the middle piece of wood,
and I made a little lightning-bolt symbol above the letters. It
looked pretty professional, I have to say. Dad was like, &quot;Wow,
Jackie! You were right about the sled!&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
The next day, we went back to Skeleton Hill with Lightning. It was
the fastest thing I've ever ridden—so, so, so much faster than the
plastic sleds we'd been using. And because it had gotten warmer
outside, the snow had become crunchier and wetter: good packing snow.
Me and Jamie took turns on Lightning all afternoon. We were in the
park until our fingers were frozen and our lips had turned a little
blue. Dad practically had to drag us home.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.29in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
By the end of the weekend, the snow had started turning gray and
yellow, and then a rainstorm turned most of the snow to slush. When
we got back to school on Monday, there was no snow left.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">

My parents are not rich. I say this because people sometimes think
that everyone who goes to private school is rich, but that isn't true
with us. Dad's a teacher and Mom's a social worker, which means they
don't have those kinds of jobs where people make gazillions of
dollars. We used to have a car, but we sold it when Jamie started
kindergarten at Beecher Prep. We don't live in a big townhouse or in
one of those doorman buildings along the park. We live on the top
floor of a five-story walk-up we rent from an old lady named Doña
Petra all the way on the &quot;other&quot; side of Broadway. That's
&quot;code&quot; for the section of North River Heights where people
don't want to park their cars. Me and Jamie share a room. I overhear

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;Dude,

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Believe me, it's so boring,&quot; he said. &quot;My grandmother
lives in this house in the middle of nowhere. It's like an hour away

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: always">
about school is all the homework we get. It's not enough that we have
to sit through class after class and try to stay awake while they
fill our heads with all this stuff we will probably never need to
know, like how to figure out the surface area of a cube or what the
difference is between kinetic and potential energy. I'm like, who

I hate science the most out of all my classes. We get so much work
it's not even funny! And the teacher, Ms. Rubin, is so strict about

When me and August were still friends, I was doing okay in science

August has the neatest handwriting of anybody I've ever seen who's a

small round loopy letters. But now that we're ex-friends, it's bad

then in my head I was going, Oh noooooo! like that kid in <I>Home

was the face I was making on the inside. And then I thought of those

meant by &quot;bleeding scream.&quot; It's so weird how it all just

Weirdly enough, when we got back home and Mom brought in the mail,
there were holiday cards from both Julian's family and August's

looking like he was about to go to the opera or something. August's
holiday card was of a cute old dog wearing reindeer antlers, a red
nose, and red booties. There was a cartoon bubble above the dog's
head that read: &quot;Ho-Ho-Ho!&quot; On the inside of the card it
read:</P>

To that end, I wonder if Jack's unexpectedly violent behavior might
have been a result of too much pressure being placed on his young
shoulders? I am speaking specifically of the new child with special
needs who both Jack and Julian were asked to &quot;befriend.&quot; In
retrospect, and having now seen the child in question at various
school functions and in the  class pictures, I think it may have been
too much to  ask of our children to be able to process all that.
Certainly, when Julian mentioned he was having a hard time
befriending the boy, we told him he was &quot;off the hook&quot; in
that regard. We think the transition to middle school is hard enough
without having to place greater burdens or hardships on these young,
impressionable minds. I should also mention that, as a member of the
school board, I was a little disturbed that more consideration was
not given during this child's application process to the fact that
Beecher Prep is not an inclusion school. There are many
parents—myself included—who question the decision to let this
child into our school at all. At the very least, I am somewhat
troubled that this child was not held to the same stringent
application standards (i.e. interview) that the rest of the incoming
middle-school students were.</P>

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Dear Mrs. Albans,</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0in; line-height: 115%">
Thanks for your email outlining your concerns. Were I not convinced
that Jack Will is extremely sorry for his actions, and were I not
confident that he would not repeat those actions, rest assured that I
would not be allowing him back to Beecher Prep.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; text-indent: 0.05in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
As for your other concerns regarding our new student August, please
note that he does not have special needs. He is neither disabled,
handicapped, nor developmentally delayed in any way, so there was no
reason to assume anyone would take issue with his admittance to
Beecher Prep—whether it is an inclusion school or not. In terms of
the application process, the admissions director and I both felt it
within our right to hold the interview off-site at August's home for
reasons that are obvious.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.21in; margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: always">
We felt that this slight break in protocol was warranted but in no
way prejudicial—in one way or another—to the application review.
August is an extremely good student, and has secured the friendship
of some truly exceptional young people, including Jack Will.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.11in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
At the beginning of the school year, when I enlisted certain children
to be a &quot;welcoming committee&quot; to August, I did so as a way
of easing his transition into a school environment. I did not think
asking these children to be especially kind to a new student would
place any extra &quot;burdens or hardships&quot; on them. In fact, I
thought it would teach them a thing or two about empathy, and
friendship, and loyalty.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
As it turns out, Jack Will didn't need to learn any of these
virtues—he already had them in abundance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 3.97in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 186%">

We are very touched by your concern regarding Jack's friendship with
August. Please know we have asked Jack if he felt any undue pressure

Despite what Tushman said, there was no &quot;clean slate&quot; when
I went back to school in January. In fact, things were totally weird
from the second I got to my locker in the morning. I'm next to Amos,
who's always been a pretty straight-up kid, and I was like, &quot;Yo,
what up?&quot; and he basically just nodded a half hello and closed
his locker door and left. I was like, okay, that was bizarre. And
then I said: &quot;Hey, what up?&quot; to Henry, who didn't even
bother half-smiling but just looked away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Okay, so something's up. Dissed by two people in less than five
minutes. Not that anyone's counting. I thought I'd try one more time,
with Tristan, and boom, same thing. He actually looked nervous, like
he was afraid of talking to me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.12in; margin-top: 0.14in">
I've got a form of the Plague now, is what I thought. This is

And that's pretty much how it went all morning. Nobody talked to me.
Not true: the girls were totally normal with me. And August talked to
me, of course. And, actually, I have to say both Maxes said hello,
which made me feel kind of bad for never, ever hanging out with them
in the five years I've been in their class.</P>

I hoped lunch would be better, but it wasn't. I sat down at my usual
table with Luca and Isaiah. I guess I thought since they weren't in
the super-popular group but were kind of middle-of-the-road jock kids
that I'd be safe with them. But they barely nodded when I said hello.
Then, when our table was called, they got their lunches and never
came back. I saw them find a table way over at the other end of the 
cafeteria. They weren't at Julian's table, but they were near him,
like on the fringe of popularity. So anyway, I'd been ditched. I knew
table switching was something that happened in the fifth grade, but I
never thought it would happen to me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; text-indent: 0.05in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
It felt really awful being at the table by myself. I felt like
everyone was watching me. It also made me feel like I had no friends.
I decided to skip lunch and go read in the library.</P>

&quot;Right, not everybody. Duh. But like even parents were there,

&quot;I know. Anyway, Julian said that he thinks being friends with
Auggie is bringing you down, and that for your own good you need to
stop hanging out with him so much. And if you start losing all your
old friends, it'll be like a big wake-up call. So basically, for your
own good, he's going to stop being your friend completely.&quot;</P>

Tables</H2>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.11in; margin-top: 0.17in; line-height: 115%">
The next day at lunch, stupid me, I sat down at a table with Tristan,
Nino, and Pablo. I thought maybe they were safe because they weren't
really considered popular, but they weren't out there playing D&amp;D
at recess, either. They were sort of in-betweeners. And, at first, I
thought I scored because they were basically too nice to not
acknowledge my presence when I walked over to the table. They all
said &quot;Hey,&quot; though I could tell they looked at each other.
But then the same thing happened that happened yesterday: our lunch
table was called, they got their food, and then headed toward a new
table on the other side of the cafeteria.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Unfortunately, Mrs. G, who was the lunch teacher that day, saw what
happened and chased after them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;That's not allowed, boys!&quot; she scolded them loudly. &quot;This
is not that kind of school. You get right back to your table.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.15in; margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: always">
Oh great, like that was going to help. Before they could be forced to
sit back down at the table, I got up with my tray and walked away
really fast. I could hear Mrs. G call my name, but I pretended not to
hear and just kept walking to the other side of the cafeteria, behind
the lunch counter.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;Sit

It was Summer. She and August were sitting at their table, and they
were both waving me over.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.91in">Why I
Didn't Sit with August the First Day of School</H2>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.18in; line-height: 115%">
Okay, I'm a total hypocrite. I know. That very first day of school I
remember seeing August in the cafeteria. Everybody was looking at
him. Talking about him. Back then, no one was used to his face or
even knew that he was coming to Beecher, so it was a total shocker
for a lot of people to see him there on the first day of school. Most
kids were even afraid to get near him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
So when I saw him going into the cafeteria ahead of me, I knew he'd
have no one to sit with, but I just couldn't bring myself to sit with
him. I had been hanging out with him all morning long because we had
so many classes together, and I guess I was just kind of wanting a
little normal time to chill with other kids. So when I saw him move
to a table on the other side of the lunch counter, I purposely found
a table as far away from there as I could find. I sat down with
Isaiah and Luca even though I'd never met them before, and we talked
about baseball the whole time, and I played basketball with them at
recess. They became my lunch table from then on.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
I heard Summer had sat down with August, which surprised me because I
knew for a fact she wasn't one of the kids that Tushman had talked to
about being friends with Auggie. So I knew she was doing it just to
be nice, and that was pretty brave, I thought.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
So now here I was sitting with Summer and August, and they were being
totally nice to me as always. I filled them in about everything
Charlotte had told me, except for the whole big part about my having
&quot;snapped&quot; under the pressure of being Auggie's friend, or
the part about Julian's mom saying that Auggie had special needs, or
the part about the school board. I guess all I really told them about
was how Julian had had a holiday party and managed to turn the whole
grade against me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;It just feels so weird,&quot; I said, &quot;to not have people
talking to you, pretending you don't even exist.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">Auggie

It was already the middle of January, and we still hadn't even chosen
what science-fair project we were going to work on. I guess I kept
putting it off because I just didn't want to do it. Finally, August
was like, &quot;Dude, we have to do this.&quot; So we went to his

I was really nervous because I didn't know if August had ever told
his parents about what we now called the Halloween Incident. Turns
out the dad wasn't even home and the mom was out running errands. I'm
pretty sure from the two seconds I'd spent talking to her that Auggie
had never mentioned a thing about it. She was super cool and friendly

i shouldn't be, of course. olivia's told me about his &quot;syndrome.&quot;
has even described what he looks like. but she's also talked about
all his surgeries over the years, so i guess i assumed he'd be more
normal-looking by now. like when a kid is born with a cleft palate
and has plastic surgery to fix it sometimes you can't even tell
except for the little scar above the lip. i guess i thought her
brother would have some scars here and there. but not this. i
definitely wasn't expecting to see this little kid in a baseball cap
who's sitting in front of me right now.</P>

liked her. i couldn't keep my eyes off of her. really beautiful. with
olive skin and the bluest eyes i've ever seen in my life. at first
she acted like she only wanted to be friends. i think she kind of
gives off that vibe without even meaning to. stay back. don't even
bother. she doesn't flirt like some other girls do. she looks you
right in the eye when she talks to you, like she's daring you. so i
just kept looking her right in the eye, too, like i was daring her
right back. and then i asked her out and she said yes, which rocked.</P>

she's an awesome girl and i love hanging out with her. she didn't
tell me about august until our third date. i think she used the
phrase &quot;a craniofacial abnormality&quot; to describe his face.

she didn't use was &quot;deformed,&quot; though, because that word

me about my music, how i got into the fiddle and stuff like that. and
i tell them about how i used to play classical violin but I got into
appalachian folk music and then zydeco. and they're listening to
every word like they're really interested. they tell me to let them
know the next time my band's playing a gig so they can come listen.</P>

have a clue about what I want to do with my life. they never ask. we
never talk like this. i don't think they even know i traded my
baroque violin for an eight-string hardanger fiddle two years ago.
after dinner we go back to olivia's for some ice cream. their dog
greets us at the door. an old dog. super sweet. she'd thrown up all
over the hallway, though. olivia's mom rushes to get paper towels

subway one day, he says, and a homeless guy i've never seen in this
neighborhood before is pushing this floppy mutt in a stroller, and he
comes up to me and says, hey, mister, wanna buy my dog? and without
even thinking about it, i say sure, how much you want? and he says
ten bucks, so i give him the twenty dollars i have in my wallet and
he hands me the dog. justin, i'm telling you,  you've never smelled
anything so bad in your life! she stank so much i can't even tell

as long as i can remember, i've felt like my parents could hardly
wait for me to be old enough to take care of myself. &quot;you can go
to the store by yourself.&quot; &quot;here's the key to the
apartment.&quot; it's funny how there's a word like overprotective to
describe some parents, but no word that means the opposite. what word
do you use to describe parents who don't protect enough?
underprotective? neglectful? self-involved? lame? all of the above.</P>

we're doing the play our town for the spring show this year. olivia
dares me to try out for the lead role, the stage manager, and somehow
i get it. total fluke. never got any lead roles in anything before. i
tell olivia she brings me good luck. unfortunately, she doesn't get
the female lead, emily  gibbs. the pink-haired girl named miranda
gets it. olivia gets a bit part and is also the emily understudy. i'm
actually more disappointed than olivia is. she almost seems relieved.
i don't love people staring at me, she says, which is sort of strange
 coming from such a pretty girl. a part of me thinks maybe  she blew
her audition on purpose. the spring show is at the end of april. it's
mid-march now, so that's less than six weeks to memorize my part.
plus rehearsal time. plus practicing with my band. plus finals. plus
spending time with olivia. it's  going to be a rough six weeks,
that's for sure. mr. davenport, the drama teacher, is already manic
about the whole thing. will drive us crazy by the time it's over, no
doubt. i heard through the grapevine that he'd been planning on doing
the  elephant man but changed it to our town at the last minute, and
that change took a week off of our rehearsal schedule.</P>

my fiddle with me onstage and play it a bit while i'm talking. It's
not written that way, but mr. davenport thinks it adds an
extra-folksy element to have the stage manager plucking on a fiddle.

my next line, i just start playing a little &quot;soldier's joy&quot;
on my fiddle and it buys me some time.</P>

The Spud Lamp was a big hit at the science fair. Jack and I got an A
for it. It was the first A Jack got in any class all year long, so he
was psyched.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
All the science-fair projects were set up on tables in the gym. It
was the same setup as the Egyptian Museum back in December, except
this time there were volcanoes and</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: always">
molecule dioramas on the tables instead of pyramids and pharaohs. And
instead of the kids taking our parents around to look at everybody
else's artifact, we had to stand by our tables while all the parents
wandered around the room and came over to us one by one.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Here's the math on that one: Sixty kids in the grade equals sixty
sets of parents—and doesn't even include grandparents. So that's a
minimum of one hundred and twenty pairs of eyes that find their way
over to me. Eyes that aren't as used to me as their kids' eyes are by
now. It's like how compass needles always point north, no matter
which way you're facing. All those eyes are compasses, and I'm like
the North Pole to them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.14in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
That's why I still don't like school events that include parents. I
don't hate them as much as I did at the beginning  of the school
year. Like the Thanksgiving Sharing Festival: that was the worst one,
I think. That was the first time I had to face the parents all at
once. The Egyptian Museum came after that, but that one was okay
because I got to dress up as a mummy and nobody noticed me. Then came
the winter concert, which I totally hated because I had to sing in
the chorus. Not only can I not sing at all, but it felt like I was on
display. The New Year Art Show wasn't quite as bad, but it was still
annoying. They put up our artwork in the hallways all over the school
and had the parents come and check it out. It was like starting
school all over again, having unsuspecting adults pass me on the
stairway.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Anyway, it's not that I care that people react to me. Like I've said
a gazillion times: I'm used to that by now. I don't let it bother me.
It's like when you go outside and it's drizzling a little. You don't

a made-up person that me and Jack came up with. She had really gross
habits, like eating the green stuff in between her toes and sucking
on her knuckles. And we figured someone like that would have a real
crush on Julian, who looked and acted like someone in a KidzBop
commercial.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.2in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
There were also a couple of times in February when Julian, Miles, and
Henry played tricks on Jack. They didn't play tricks on me, I think,
because they knew that if they got caught &quot;bullying&quot; me, it
would be big-time trouble for them. Jack, they figured, was an easier
target. So one time they stole his gym shorts and played Monkey in
the Middle with them in the locker room. Another time Miles, who sat
next to Jack in homeroom, swiped Jack's worksheet off his desk,
crumpled it in a ball, and tossed it to Julian across the room. This
wouldn't have happened if Ms. Petosa had been there, of course, but
there was a substitute teacher that day, and subs never really know
what's going on. Jack was good about this stuff. He never let them
see he was upset, though I think sometimes he was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
The other kids in the grade knew about the war. Except for Savanna's
group, the girls were neutral at first. But by March they were
getting sick of it. And so were some of the boys. Like another time
when Julian was dumping some pencilsharpener shavings into Jack's
backpack, Amos, who was usually tight with them, grabbed the backpack
out of Julian's hands and returned it to Jack. It was starting to
feel like the majority of boys weren't buying into Julian anymore.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: always">
Then a few weeks ago, Julian started spreading this ridiculous rumor
that Jack had hired some &quot;hit man&quot; to &quot;get&quot; him
and Miles and Henry. This lie was so pathetic that people were
actually laughing about him behind his back. At that point, any boys
who had still been on his side now jumped ship and were clearly
neutral. So by the end of March, only Miles and Henry were on
Julian's side—and I think even they were getting tired of the war
by then.</P>

people borrow my pencils without acting like the pencil has cooties.</P>

People even joke around with me now sometimes. Like the other day I
saw Maya writing a note to Ellie on a piece of Uglydoll stationery,
and I don't know why, but I just kind of randomly said: &quot;Did you
know the guy who created the Uglydolls based them on me?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Maya looked at me with her eyes wide open like she totally believed
me. Then, when she realized I was only kidding, she thought it was
the funniest thing in the world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;You are so funny, August!&quot; she said, and then she told
Ellie and some of the other girls what I had just said, and they all
thought it was funny, too. Like at first they were shocked, but then
when they saw I was laughing about it, they knew it was okay to laugh
about it, too. And the next day I found a little Uglydoll key chain
sitting on my chair with a nice little note from Maya that said: For
the nicest Auggie Doll in the world! XO Maya.</P>

Ever since I was little, the doctors told my parents that someday I'd
need hearing aids. I don't know why this always freaked me out a bit:
maybe because anything to do with my ears bothers me a lot.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
My hearing was getting worse, but I hadn't told anyone about it. The
ocean sound that was always in my head had been getting louder. It
was drowning out people's voices, like I was underwater. I couldn't
hear teachers if I sat in the back of the class. But I knew if I told
Mom or Dad about it, I'd end up with hearing aids—and I was hoping
I could make it through the fifth grade without having that happen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.11in; margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: always">
But then in my annual checkup in October I flunked the audiology test
and the doctor was like, &quot;Dude, it's time.&quot; And he sent me
to a special ear doctor who took impressions of my ears.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.17in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Out of all my features, my ears are the ones I hate the most. They're
like tiny closed fists on the sides of my face. They're too low on my
head, too. They look like squashed pieces of pizza dough sticking out
of the top of my neck or something.  Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating a
little. But I really hate them.</P>

See, normal hearing aids usually have a part that wraps around the
outer ear to hold the inner bud in place. But in my case, since I
don't have outer ears, they had to put the earbuds on this heavy-duty
headband that was supposed to wrap around the back of my head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;I

How can I describe what I heard when the doctor turned on my hearing

a room where one of the lightbulbs on the ceiling isn't working, but
you don't realize how dark it is until someone changes the lightbulb
and then you're like, whoa, it's so bright in here! I don't know if

&quot;The white noise is gone,&quot; he said, nodding. He looked at

&quot;That's because you have bionic hearing now, buddy,&quot; said
the ear doctor, adjusting the right side. &quot;Now touch here.&quot;
He put my hand behind the hearing aid. &quot;Do you feel that? That's
the volume. You have to find the volume that works  for you. We're
going to do that next. Well, what do you think?&quot; He picked up a
small mirror and had me look in the big mirror at how the hearing
aids looked in the back. My hair covered most of the headband. The
only part that peeked out was the tubing.</P>

The first day I showed up at school with the hearing aids, I thought
kids would make a big deal about it. But no one did. Summer was glad
I could hear better, and Jack said it made me look like an FBI agent
or something. But that was it. Mr. Browne asked me about it in
English class, but it wasn't like, what the heck is that thing on
your head?! It was more like, &quot;If you ever need me to repeat
something, Auggie, make sure you tell me, okay?&quot;</P>

A couple of days after spring break ended, Mom found out that Via
hadn't told her about a school play that was happening at her high
school the next week. And Mom was mad. Mom doesn't really get mad
that much (though Dad would disagree with</P>

that), but she was really mad at Via for that. She and Via got into a
huge fight. I could hear them yelling at each other in Via's room. My

lately, Via? You're moody and taciturn and secretive. . . .&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; text-indent: 0.09in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;What is so wrong with my not telling you about a stupid play?&quot;
Via practically screamed. &quot;I don't even have a speaking part in

By dinner they seemed to have made up. Dad was working late. Daisy

an appointment to take her to the vet the next morning.</P>

The three of us were sitting down and no one was talking. Finally, I

didn't answer but looked down at her plate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;You know, Auggie,&quot; said Mom quietly. &quot;I hadn't

I ran down the hallway to my room and slammed the door behind me so
hard that I actually heard little pieces of the wall crumble inside
the door frame. Then I plopped onto my bed and pulled the covers up
on top of me. I threw my pillows over my disgusting face and then
piled all my stuffed animals on top of the pillows, like I was inside
a little cave. If I could walk around with a pillow over my face all
the time, I would.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
I don't even know how I got so mad. I wasn't really mad at the

all kind of just exploded out of me. I knew Via didn't want me to go
to her stupid play. And I knew why.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
I figured Mom would follow me into my room right away, but she
didn't. I wanted her to find me inside my cave of stuffed animals, so

I made a little hole through the pile of pillows and stuffed animals

still hadn't come into my room. I tried to listen for the sounds in
the other rooms. Were they still having dinner? What was going on?</P>

&quot;I'm sorry, Auggie,&quot; she said softly. &quot;I'm really

Mom and Dad came home two hours later. We knew the second they opened
the door and Daisy wasn't with them that Daisy was gone. We all sat
down in the living room around the pile of Daisy's toys. Dad told us
what happened at the animal hospital, how the vet took Daisy for some
Xrays and blood tests, then came back and told them she had a huge
mass in her stomach. She was having trouble breathing. Mom and Dad
didn't want her to suffer, so Daddy picked her up in his arms like he
always liked to do, with her legs straight up in the air, and he and
Mom kissed her goodbye over and over again and whispered to her while
the vet put a needle into her leg. And then after about a minute she
died in Daddy's arms. It was so peaceful, Daddy said. She wasn't in
any pain at all. Like she was just going to sleep. A couple of times
while he talked, Dad's voice got trembly and he cleared his throat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.14in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
I've never seen Dad cry before, but I saw him cry tonight. I had gone
into Mom and Dad's bedroom looking for Mom to put me to bed, but saw
Dad sitting on the edge of the bed, taking off his socks. His back
was to the door, so he didn't know I was there. At first I thought he
was laughing because his shoulders were shaking, but then he put his
palms on his eyes and I realized he was crying. It was the quietest
crying I've ever heard. Like a whisper. I was going to go over to
him, but then I thought maybe he was whisper-crying because he didn't
want me or anyone else to hear him. So I walked out and went to Via's
room, and I saw Mom lying next to Via on the bed, and Mom was
whispering to Via, who was crying.</P>

So I went to my bed and put on my pajamas without anyone telling me
to and put the night-light on and turned the light off and crawled
into the little mountain of stuffed animals I had left on my bed
earlier. It felt like that all had happened a  million years ago. I
took my hearing aids off and put them on the night table and pulled
the covers up to my ears and imagined Daisy snuggling with me, her
big wet tongue licking my face all over like it was her favorite face
in the world. And that's how I fell asleep.</P>

Via brought home three tickets to her school play a few days after

hallways. More room for people. The only really bad thing about my

come in really handy. Sometimes I wish I could still get away with

40 minutes; longitude 70 degrees 37 minutes. The First Act shows a
day in our town. The day is May 7, 1901. The time is just before

After the curtain closed, everyone in the audience started clapping.

ones out, and when they appeared, the whole audience rose to their
feet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 2.76in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 187%">

At that moment, a man who I think was their teacher came over to
Justin and Via, clapping his hands.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 1.82in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 186%">
&quot;Bravo, bravo! Olivia and Justin!&quot; He kissed Via on both
cheeks. &quot;I flubbed a couple of lines,&quot; said Via, shaking
her head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 2.4in; margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 187%; page-break-before: always">
&quot;But you got through it,&quot; said the man, smiling ear to ear.
&quot;Mr. Davenport, these are my parents,&quot; said Via.</P>

&quot;You must be so proud of your girl!&quot; he said, shaking their
hands with both his hands. &quot;We are!&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 0.19in">&quot;And
this is my little brother, August,&quot; said Via.</P>

He looked like he was about to say something but suddenly froze when
he looked at me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;Mr.

Via was about to say something to me, but then someone else came over
and started talking to her, and before I knew it, I was kind of alone
in the crowd. I mean, I knew where Mom and Dad were, but there were
so many people all around us, and people kept bumping into me,
spinning me around a bit, giving me that one-two look, which made me
feel kind of bad. I don't know if it was because I was feeling hot or
something, but I kind of started getting dizzy. People's faces were
blurring in my head. And their voices were so loud it was almost
hurting my ears. I tried to turn the volume down on my Lobot ears,
but I got confused and turned them louder at first, which kind of
shocked me. And then I looked up and I didn't see Mom or Dad or Via
anywhere.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Via?&quot; I yelled out. I started pushing through the crowd to
find Mom. &quot;Mommy!&quot; I really couldn't see anything but
people's stomachs and ties all around me. &quot;Mommy!&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; text-indent: 0.05in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Suddenly someone picked me up from behind. &quot;Look who's here!&quot;
said a familiar voice, hugging me tight. I thought it was Via at
first, but when I turned around, I was completely surprised. &quot;Hey,
Major Tom!&quot; she said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;Miranda!&quot;
I answered, and I gave her the tightest hug I could give.</P>

Camp Lies</H2>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.17in; line-height: 115%">
My parents got divorced the summer before ninth grade. My father was
with someone else right away. In fact, though my mother never said
so, I think this was the reason they got divorced.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
After the divorce, I hardly ever saw my father. And my mother acted
stranger than ever. It's not that she was unstable or anything: just
distant. Remote. My mother is the  kind of person who has a happy
face for the rest of the world but not a lot left over for me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.11in; line-height: 115%">
She's never talked to me much—not about her feelings, her life. I
don't know much about what she was like when she was my age. Don't
know much about the things she liked or didn't like. The few times
she mentioned her own parents, who I've never met, it was mostly
about how she wanted to get as far away from them as she could once
she'd grown up. She never told me why. I  asked a few times, but she
would pretend she hadn't heard me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.15in; margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: always">
I didn't want to go to camp that summer. I had wanted to stay with
her, to help her through the divorce. But she insisted I go away. I
figured she wanted the alone time, so I gave it to her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.09in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Camp was awful. I hated it. I thought it would be better being a
junior counselor, but it wasn't. No one I knew from the previous year
had come back, so I didn't know anyone— not a single person. I'm
not even sure why, but I started playing this little make-believe
game with the girls in the camp. They'd ask me stuff about myself,
and I'd make things up: my parents are in Europe, I told them. I live
in a huge  townhouse on the nicest street in North River Heights. I
have a dog named Daisy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.14in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Then one day I blurted out that I had a little brother who was
deformed. I have absolutely no idea why I said this: it just seemed
like an interesting thing to say. And, of course, the reaction I got
from the little girls in the bungalow was dramatic. Really? So sorry!
That must be tough! Et cetera. Et cetera. I regretted saying this the
moment it escaped from my lips, of course: I felt like such a fake.
If Via ever found out, I thought, she'd think I was such a weirdo.
And I felt like a weirdo. But, I have to admit, there was a part of
me that felt a little entitled to this lie. I've known Auggie since I
was six years old. I've watched him grow up. I've played  with him.
I've watched all six episodes of <I>Star Wars </I>for his sake, so I
could talk to him about the aliens and bounty hunters and all that.
I'm the one that gave him the astronaut helmet he wouldn't take off
for two years. I mean, I've kind of earned the right to think of him
as my brother.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
And the strangest thing is that these lies I told, these fictions,
did wonders for my popularity. The other junior counselors heard it
from the campers, and they were all over it. Never in my life have I
ever been considered one of the &quot;popular&quot; girls in
anything, but that summer in camp, for whatever reason, I was the
girl everybody wanted to hang out with. Even the girls in bungalow 32
were totally into me. These were the girls at the top of the food
chain. They said they liked my hair (though they changed it). They
said they liked the way I did my makeup (though they changed that,
too). They showed me how to turn my T-shirts into halter tops. We
smoked. We snuck out late at night and took the path through the
woods to the boys' camp. We hung out with boys.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.08in; margin-right: 0.1in; text-indent: 0in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
When I got home from camp, I called Ella right away to make plans
with her. I don't know why I didn't call Via. I guess I just didn't
feel like talking about stuff with her. She would have asked me about
my parents, about camp. Ella never really asked me about things. She
was an easier friend to have in that way. She wasn't serious like
Via. She was fun. She thought it was cool when I dyed my hair pink.
She wanted to hear all about those trips through the woods late at
night.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 3.02in; margin-top: 0.05in; page-break-before: always">
School</H2>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.17in; line-height: 115%">
I hardly saw Via at school this year, and when I did it was awkward.
It felt like she was judging me. I knew she didn't like my new look.
I knew she didn't like my group of friends.  I didn't much like hers.
We never actually argued: we just  drifted away. Ella and I
badmouthed her to each other: She's such a prude, she's so this,
she's so that. We knew we were being mean, but it was easier to ice
her out if we pretended she had done something to us. The truth is
she hadn't changed at all: we had. We'd become these other people,
and she was still the person she'd always been. That annoyed me so
much and I didn't know why.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Once in a while I'd look to see where she was sitting in the
lunchroom, or check the elective lists to see what she'd signed up
for. But except for a few nods in the hallway and an occasional
&quot;hello,&quot; we never really spoke to each other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
I noticed Justin about halfway through the school year. I hadn't
noticed him at all before then, other than that he was this skinny
cutish dude with thick glasses and longish hair who carried a violin
everywhere. Then one day I saw him in front of the school with his
arm around Via. &quot;So Via has a boyfriend!&quot; I said to Ella,
kind of mocking. I don't know why it surprised me that she'd have a
boyfriend. Out of the three of us, she was totally the prettiest:
blue, blue eyes and long wavy dark hair. But she'd just never acted
like she was at all  interested in boys. She acted like she was too
smart for that  kind of stuff.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
I had a boyfriend, too: a guy named Zack. When I told him I was
choosing the theater elective, he shook his head and said: &quot;Careful
you don't turn into a drama geek.&quot; Not the most sympathetic dude
in the world, but very cute. Very high up on the totem pole. A
varsity jock.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
I wasn't planning on taking theater at first. Then I saw Via's name
on the sign-up sheet and just wrote my name down on the list. I don't
even know why. We managed to avoid one another throughout most of the
semester, like we didn't even know each other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.26in; margin-top: 0in; line-height: 115%">
Then one day I got to theater class a little early, and Davenport
asked me to run off additional copies of the play he was planning on
having us do for the spring production: The Elephant Man. I'd heard
about it but I didn't really know what it was about, so I started
skimming through the pages while I was waiting for the xerox machine.
It was about a man who lived more than a hundred years ago named John
Merrick who was terribly deformed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;We can't do this play, Mr. D,&quot; I told him when I got back
to class, and I told him why: my little brother has a birth defect
and has a deformed face and this play would hit too close to home. He
seemed annoyed and a little unsympathetic, but I kind of said that</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 113%; page-break-before: always">
my parents would have a real issue with the school doing this play.
So anyway, he ended up switching to <I>Our Town</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
I think I went for the role of Emily Gibbs because I knew Via was
going to go for it, too. It never occurred to me that I'd beat her
for the role.</P>

Miss Most</H2>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.17in; line-height: 115%">
One of the things I miss the most about Via's friendship is her
family. I loved her mom and dad. They were always so welcoming and
nice to me. I knew they loved their kids more than anything. I always
felt safe around them: safer than anywhere else in the world. How
pathetic that I felt safer in someone else's house than in my own,
right?</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.26in; margin-top: 0in; line-height: 115%">
And, of course, I loved Auggie. I was never afraid of him: even when
I was little. I had friends that couldn't believe I'd ever go over to
Via's house. &quot;His face creeps me out,&quot; they'd say. &quot;You're
stupid,&quot; I'd tell them. Auggie's face isn't so bad once you get
used to it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
I called Via's house once just to say hello to Auggie. Maybe part of
me was hoping Via would answer, I don't know.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;Hey,

&quot;Miranda!&quot; He sounded so happy to hear my voice it actually

now!&quot; he told me excitedly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.26in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Really? Wow!&quot; I said, totally shocked. I guess I never
thought he'd go to a regular school. His parents have always been so
protective of him. I guess I thought he'd always be that little kid
in the astronaut helmet I gave him. Talking to him, I could tell he
had no idea that Via and I weren't close anymore. &quot;It's
different in high school,&quot; I explained to him. &quot;You end up
hanging out with loads of different people.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;I have some friends in my new school,&quot; he told me. &quot;A

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">

Neither my mother nor my father could come see the play on opening
night: my mother because she had this thing at work, and my dad
because his new wife was going to have her baby any second now, and
he had to be on call.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Zack couldn't come to opening night, either: he had a volleyball game
against Collegiate he couldn't miss. In fact, he had wanted me to
miss the opening night so I could come cheer him on. My &quot;friends&quot;
all went to the game, of course, because all their boyfriends were
playing. Even Ella didn't come. Given a choice, she chose the crowd.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
So on opening night no one that was remotely close to me was even
there. And the thing is, I realized in my third or fourth rehearsal
that I was good at this acting thing. I felt the part. I understood
the words I spoke. I could read the lines as if they were coming from
my brain and my heart. And on opening night, I can honestly say I
knew I was going to be more than good: I was going to be great. I was
going to be extraordinary, but there would be no one there to see.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
We were all backstage, nervously running through our lines in our
heads. I peeked through the curtain at the people taking their seats
in the auditorium. That's when I saw Auggie walking down the aisle
with Isabel and Nate. They took three seats in the fifth row, near
the middle. Auggie was wearing a bow tie, looking around excitedly.
He had grown up a bit since I'd last seen him, almost a year ago. His
hair was shorter, and he was wearing some kind of hearing aid now.
His face hadn't changed a bit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Davenport was running through some last-minute changes with the set
decorator. I saw Justin pacing off stage left, mumbling his lines
nervously.</P>

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; line-height: 115%">
Davenport took a deep breath, like he was trying to restrain himself.
To be truthful, I thought he looked like he was going to explode. His
forehead turned bright pink. &quot;Miranda, this is absolutely
unacceptable! Now go take a few deep breaths and—&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.12in; margin-top: 0.14in">

&quot;Yeah! Hurry up!&quot; Via, looking stunned, took off her
T-shirt and jeans and pulled the long dress over her head. I pulled
it down for her, and then zipped up the back. Luckily, Emily Webb
didn't go on until ten minutes into the play, so the girl handling
hair and makeup had time to put Via's hair up in a twist and do a
quick makeup job. I'd never seen Via with a lot of makeup on: she
looked like a model.</P>

I watched the rest of the play from the wings just offstage, next to
Davenport. Justin was amazing, and Via, in that heartbreaking last
scene, was awesome. There was one line she flubbed a bit, but Justin
covered for her, and no one in the audience even noticed. I heard
Davenport muttering under his breath: &quot;Good, good, good.&quot;
He was more nervous than all of the students put together: the
actors, the set decorators, the lighting team, the guy handling the
curtains. Davenport was a wreck, frankly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
The only time I felt any regret, if you could even call it that, was
at the end of the play when everyone went out for their curtain
calls. Via and Justin were the last of the actors walking out
onstage, and the audience rose to their feet when they took their
bows.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.22in; line-height: 115%">
That, I admit, was a little bittersweet for me. But just a few
minutes later I saw Nate and Isabel and Auggie make their way
backstage, and they all seemed so happy. Everyone was congratulating
the actors, patting them on the back. It was that crazy backstage
theater mayhem where sweaty actors stand euphoric while people come
worship them for a few seconds. In that crush of people, I noticed
Auggie looking kind of lost. I cut through the crowd as fast as I
could and came up behind him.</P>

Every year in the spring, the fifth graders of Beecher Prep go away
for three days and two nights to a place called the Broarwood Nature
Reserve in Pennsylvania. It's a four-</P>

hour bus drive away. The kids sleep in cabins with bunk beds. There
are campfires and s'mores and long walks through the woods. The
teachers have been prepping us about this all year long, so all the
kids in the grade are excited about it— except for me. And it's not
even that I'm not excited, because I kind of am—it's just I've
never slept away from home before and I'm kind of nervous.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.12in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Most kids have had sleepovers by the time they're my age. A lot of
kids have gone to sleepaway camps, or stayed with their grandparents
or whatever. Not me. Not unless you include hospital stays, but even
then Mom or Dad always  stayed with me overnight. But I never slept
over Tata and Poppa's house, or Aunt Kate and Uncle Po's house. When
I was really little, that was mainly because there were too many
medical issues, like my trache tube needing to be cleared every hour,
or reinserting my feeding tube if it got detached. But when I got
bigger, I just never felt like sleeping anywhere else. There was one
time when I half slept over Christopher's house. We were about eight,
and we were still best friends. Our family had gone for a visit to
his  house, and me and Christopher were having such a great time
playing Legos Star Wars that I didn't want to leave when it was time
to go. We were like, &quot;Please, please, please can we have a
sleepover?&quot; So our parents said yes, and Mom and Dad and Via
drove home.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; line-height: 115%">
And me and Christopher stayed up till midnight playing, until Lisa,
his mom, said: &quot;Okay, guys, time to go to bed.&quot; Well,
that's when I kind of panicked a bit. Lisa tried to help me go to
sleep, but I just started crying that I wanted to go home. So at one
a.m. Lisa called Mom and Dad, and Dad drove all the way back out to
Bridgeport to pick me up. We didn't get home until three a.m. So my
one and only sleepover, up until now, was pretty  much of a disaster,
which is why I'm a little nervous about  the nature retreat.</P>

Everyone's known for something in middle school. Like Reid is known
for really being into marine life and the oceans and things like
that. And Amos is known for being a really good baseball player. And
Charlotte is known for having been in a TV commercial when she was
six. And Ximena's known for being really smart.</P>

you're into, and you have to be careful about stuff like that. Like
Max G and Max W will never live down their Dungeons &amp; Dragons

The next day I woke up really early. It was still dark inside my room
and even darker outside, though I knew it would be morning soon. I
turned over on my side but didn't feel at all sleepy. That's when I
saw Daisy sitting near my bed. I mean, I knew it wasn't Daisy, but
for a second I saw a shadow that looked just like her. I didn't think
it was a dream then, but now, looking back, I know it must have been.
It didn't make me sad to see her at all: it just filled me up with
nice feelings inside. She was gone after a second, and I couldn't see
her again in the darkness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.12in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
The room slowly started lightening. I reached for my hearing aid
headband and put it on, and now the world was really awake. I could
hear the garbage trucks clunking down the street and the birds in our
backyard. And down the hallway I heard Mom's alarm beeping. Daisy's
ghost made me feel  super strong inside, knowing wherever I am, she'd
be there with me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.11in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
I got up out of bed and went to my desk and wrote a little note to
Mom. Then I went into the living room, where my packed bag was by the
door. I opened it up and fished inside until I found what I was
looking for.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">

The bus ride went really fast. I sat by the window and Jack was next
to me in the aisle seat. Summer and Maya were in front of us.
Everyone was in a good mood. Kind of loud, laughing a lot. I noticed
right away that Julian wasn't on our bus, even though Henry and Miles
were. I figured he must be on the other bus, but then I overheard
Miles tell Amos that Julian ditched the grade trip because he thought
the  whole nature- retreat thing was, quote unquote, dorky. I got
totally pumped because dealing with</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: always">
Julian for three days in a row—and two nights—was a major reason
that I was nervous about this whole trip. So now without him there, I
could really just relax and not worry about anything.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
We got to the nature reserve at around noon. The first thing we did
was put our stuff down in the cabins. There were three bunk beds to
every room, so me and Jack did rock, paper, scissors for the top bunk
and I won. Woo-hoo. And the other guys in the room were Reid and
Tristan, and Pablo and Nino.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
After we had lunch in the main cabin, we all went on a twohour guided
nature hike through the woods. But these were not woods like the kind
they have in Central Park: these were real woods. Giant trees that
almost totally blocked out the sunlight. Tangles of leaves and fallen
tree trunks. Howls  and chirps and really loud bird calls. There was
a slight fog, too, like a pale blue smoke all around us. So cool. The
nature  guide pointed everything out to us: the different types of
trees we were passing, the insects inside the dead logs on the 
trail, the signs of deer and bears in the woods, what types of  birds
were whistling and where to look for them. I realized  that my Lobot
hearing aids actually made me hear better than most people, because I
was usually the first person to hear a new bird call.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.12in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
It started to rain as we headed back to camp. I pulled on my rain
poncho and pulled the hood up so my hearing aids wouldn't get wet,
but my jeans and shoes got soaked by the time we reached our cabins.
Everyone got soaked. It was fun, though. We had a wet-sock fight in
the cabin.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.17in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Since it rained for the rest of the day, we spent most of the
afternoon goofing off in the rec room. They had a Ping-Pong table and
old-style arcade games like Pac-Man and Missile Command that we
played until dinnertime. Luckily, by then it had stopped raining, so
we got to have a real campfire cookout. The log benches around the
campfire were still a little damp, but we threw our jackets over them
and hung out by the fire, toasting s'mores and eating the best
roasted hot dogs I have ever, ever tasted. Mom was right about the
mosquitoes: there were tons of them. But luckily I had spritzed
myself before I left the cabin, and I wasn't eaten alive like some of
the other kids were.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
I loved hanging out by the campfire after dark. I loved the way bits
of fire dust would float up and disappear into the night air. And how
the fire lit up people's faces. I loved the sound the fire made, too.
And how the woods were so dark that you couldn't see anything around
you, and you'd look up and see a billion stars in the sky. The sky
doesn't look like that in North River Heights. I've seen it look like
that in Montauk, though: like someone sprinkled salt on a shiny black
table.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: always">
I was so tired when I got back to the cabin that I didn't need to
pull out the book to read. I fell asleep almost as fast as my head
hit the pillow. And maybe I dreamed about the stars, I don't know.</P>

The next day was just as great as the first day. We went horseback
riding in the morning, and in the afternoon we rappelled up some
ginormous trees with the help of the nature guides. By the time we
got back to the cabins for dinner, we were all really tired again.
After dinner they told us we had an hour to rest, and then we were
going to take a fifteen-minute bus ride to the fairgrounds for an
outdoor movie night. I hadn't had the chance to write a letter to Mom
and Dad and Via yet, so I wrote one telling them all about the stuff
we did that day and the day before. I pictured myself reading it to
them out loud when I got back, since there was just no way the letter
would get home before I did.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.12in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
When we got to the fairgrounds, the sun was just starting to set. It
was about seven- thirty. The shadows were really long on the grass,
and the clouds were pink and orange. It looked like someone had taken
sidewalk chalk and smudged the colors across the sky with their
fingers. It's not that I haven't seen nice sunsets before in the
city, because I have—slivers of sunsets between buildings—but I
wasn't used to seeing so much sky in every direction. Out here in the
fairgrounds, I could understand why ancient people used to think the
world was flat and the sky was a dome that closed in on top of it.
That's what it looked like from the fairgrounds, in the middle of
this huge open field.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.14in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Because we were the first school to arrive, we got to run around the
field all we wanted until the teachers told us it was time to lay out
our sleeping bags on the ground and get good viewing seats. We
unzipped our bags and laid them down like picnic blankets on the
grass in front of the giant movie screen in the middle of the field.
Then we went to the row of food trucks parked at the edge of the
field to load up on snacks and sodas and stuff like that. There were
concession stands there, too, like at a farmers' market, selling
roasted peanuts and cotton candy. And up a little farther was a short
row of carnival-type stalls, the kind where you can win a stuffed
animal if you throw a baseball into a basket. Jack and I both
tried—and failed—to win anything, but we heard Amos won a yellow
hippo and gave it to Ximena. That was the big gossip that went
around: the jock and the brainiac.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: always">
From the food trucks, you could see the cornstalks in back of the
movie screen. They covered about a third of the entire field. The
rest of the field was completely surrounded by woods. As the sun sank
lower in the sky, the tall trees at the entrance to the woods looked
dark blue.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
By the time the other school buses pulled into the parking lots, we
were back in our spots on the sleeping bags, right smack in front of
the screen: the best seats in the whole field. Everyone was passing
around snacks and having a great time. Me and Jack and Summer and
Reid and Maya played Pictionary. We could hear the sounds of the
other schools arriving, the loud laughing and talking of kids coming
out on the field on both sides of us, but we couldn't really see
them. Though the sky was still light, the sun had gone down
completely, and everything on the ground had turned deep purple. The
clouds were shadows now. We had trouble even seeing the Pictionary
cards in front of us.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Just then, without any announcement, all the lights at the ends of
the field went on at once. They were like big bright stadium lights.
I thought of that scene in Close Encounters when the alien ship lands
and they're playing that music: duh-dah-doo-da- dunnn. Everyone in
the field started applauding and cheering like something great had
just happened.</P>

&quot;Welcome, everyone. Welcome to the twenty-third annual Big Movie
Night at the Broarwood Nature Reserve. Welcome, teachers and students
from . . . MS 342: the William Heath School. . . .&quot; A big cheer
went up on the left side of the field. &quot;Welcome, teachers and
students from Glover Academy. . . .&quot; Another cheer went up, this
time from the right side of the field. &quot;And welcome, teachers
and students from . . . the Beecher Prep School!&quot; Our whole
group cheered as loudly as we could. &quot;We're thrilled to have you
as our guests here tonight, and thrilled that the weather is
cooperating—in fact, can you believe what a beautiful night this
is?&quot; Again, everyone whooped and hollered. &quot;So as we
prepare the movie, we do ask that you take a few  moments to listen
to this important announcement. The Broarwood Nature Reserve, as you
know, is dedicated to preserving our natural resources and the
environment. We ask that you leave no litter behind. Clean up after
yourselves. Be kind to nature and it will be kind to</P>

you. We ask that you keep that in mind as you walk around the
grounds. Do not venture beyond the orange cones at the edges of the
fairgrounds. Do not go into the cornfields or the woods. Please keep
the free roaming to a minimum. Even if you don't feel like watching
the movie, your fellow students may feel otherwise, so please be
courteous: no talking, no playing music, no running around. The
restrooms are located on the other side of the concession stands.
After the movie is over, it will be quite dark, so we ask that all of
you stay with your schools as you make your way back to your buses.
Teachers, there's usually at least one lost party on Big Movie Nights
at Broarwood: don't let it happen to you! Tonight's movie
presentation will be . . . <I>The Sound of Music</I><I> </I><I>!&quot;</I></P>

I immediately started clapping, even though I'd seen it a few times
before, because it was Via's favorite movie of all time. But I was
surprised that a whole bunch of kids (not from Beecher) booed and
hissed and laughed. Someone from the right side of the field even
threw a soda can at the screen, which seemed to surprise Mr. Tushman.
I saw him stand up and look in the direction of the can thrower,
though I knew he couldn't see anything in the dark.</P>

The movie started playing right away. The stadium lights dimmed.
Maria the nun was standing at the top of the mountain twirling around
and around. It had gotten chilly all of a sudden, so I put on my
yellow Montauk hoodie and adjusted the volume on my hearing aids and
leaned against my backpack and started watching.</P>

There were lots of kids from the other schools walking around by the

course, there was a huge line for the toilets.</P>

But he headed off to the row of trees at the edge of the field, 
which was past the orange cones that we were specifically  told not
to go past. And of course I followed him. And of course we didn't
have our flashlights because we forgot to bring them. It was so dark
now we literally couldn't see ten steps ahead of us as we walked
toward the woods. Luckily, the movie gave off some light, so when we
saw a flashlight coming toward us out of the woods, we knew
immediately that it was Henry, Miles, and Amos. I guess they hadn't
wanted to wait on line to use the toilets, either.</P>

his business, though it felt like he was taking forever.</P>

The woods were loud with strange sounds and chirps and croaks, like a
wall of noise coming out of the trees. Then we started hearing loud
snaps not far from us, almost like cap gun pops, that definitely
weren't insect noises. And far away, like in another world, we could
hear <I>Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens</I>.</P>

That's when we walked straight into a group of kids we didn't know.
They'd just come out of the woods, doing stuff I'm sure they didn't

smell of both firecrackers and cigarettes. They pointed a flashlight
at us. There were six of them: four boys and two girls. They looked

&quot;What is that?&quot; said the kid who was pointing the

flashlight was pointed right at my face, and what they were talking
about—screaming about—was me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Let's get out of here,&quot; Jack said to me quietly, and he
pulled me by my sweatshirt sleeve and started walking away from them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Wait wait wait!&quot; yelled the guy with the flashlight,
cutting us off. He pointed the flashlight right in my face again, and
now he was only about five feet away. &quot;Oh man! Oh man!!&quot; he
said, shaking his head, his mouth wide open. &quot;What happened to
your face?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;Stop

Jack tried to push past Eddie, but Eddie shoved his hands into Jack's

&quot;Are you talking to me, Freddie Krueger? I don't think you want

still on the ground and I wasn't about to leave him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;Yo,

&quot;Leave them alone, dude,&quot; said Amos, with Miles and Henry

Eddie.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 2.48in; margin-top: 0in; line-height: 186%">
&quot;Just leave them alone, dude,&quot; Amos repeated calmly. &quot;Are

I knew that was a lie, but I helped Jack get up, and we started
walking over to Amos. Then out of the blue, the Eddie guy grabbed my
hood as I passed by him, yanking it really hard so I was pulled
backward and fell flat on my back. It was a hard fall, and I hurt my
elbow pretty bad on a rock. I couldn't really see what happened
afterward, except that Amos rammed into the Eddie guy like a monster
truck and they both fell down to the ground next to me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.1in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Everything got really crazy after that. Someone pulled me up by my
sleeve and yelled, &quot;Run!&quot; and someone else screamed, &quot;Get
'em!&quot; at the same time, and for a few seconds I actually had two
people pulling the sleeves of my sweatshirt in opposite directions. I
heard them both cursing, until my sweatshirt ripped and the first guy
yanked me by my arm and started pulling me behind him as we ran,
which I did as fast as I could. I could hear footsteps just behind
us, chasing us, and voices shouting and girls screaming, but it  was
so dark I didn't know whose voices they were, only that everything
felt like we were underwater. We were running like crazy, and it was
pitch black, and whenever I started to slow down, the guy pulling me
by my arm would yell, &quot;Don't stop!&quot;</P>

Everything that had just happened kind of hit me and I couldn't help
it: I started to cry. Like big crying, what Mom would call &quot;the

We walked back toward the cornfields, and then cut through them until
the back of the giant screen came into view. Since it was facing away

milling around in this area, so I pulled what was left of my hoodie
over my head and kept my face down, hands in pockets, as we made our
way through the crowd. It had been a long time since I'd been out
without my hearing aids, and it felt like I was miles under the

Amos, Miles, and Henry brought me and Jack over to where we'd been
sitting before, with Summer and Maya and Reid, and then they went and
sat where they had been sitting before, with Ximena and Savanna and
their group. In a way, everything was exactly as we had left it
before we went looking for the toilets. The sky was the same. The
movie was the same. Everyone's faces were the same. Mine was the
same.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">But

I could see Amos and Miles and Henry telling their group what had
just happened. I knew they were talking about it because they kept
looking over at me while they were talking. Even though the movie was
still playing, people were whispering about it in the dark. News like
that spreads fast.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
It was what everyone was talking about on the bus ride back to the
cabins. All the girls, even girls I didn't know very well, were
asking me if I was okay. The boys were all talking about getting
revenge on the group of seventh-grade jerks, trying to figure out
what school they were from.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
I wasn't planning on telling the teachers about any of what had
happened, but they found out anyway. Maybe it was the torn sweatshirt
and the bloody elbow. Or maybe it's just that teachers hear
everything. When we got back to the camp, Mr. Tushman took me to the
first-aid office, and while I was getting my elbow cleaned and
bandaged up by the camp nurse, Mr. Tushman and the camp director were
in the next room talking with Amos and Jack and Henry and Miles,
trying to get a description of the troublemakers. When he asked me
about them a little later, I said I couldn't remember their faces at
all, which wasn't true. I</P>

The look of total horror on the girl's face when she first saw me.
The way the kid with the flashlight, Eddie, looked at me as he talked
to me, like he hated me.</P>

Mom was waiting for me in front of the school along with all the
other parents when the bus arrived. Mr. Tushman told  me on the bus
ride home that they had called my parents to tell them there had been
a &quot;situation&quot; the night before but that everyone was fine.
He said the camp director and several of the counselors went looking
for the hearing aid in the morning while we all went swimming in the
lake, but  they couldn't find it anywhere. Broarwood would reimburse
us the cost of the hearing aids, he said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 0.19in">They

I wondered if Eddie had taken my hearing aids with him as a kind of
souvenir. Something to remember the orc. Mom gave me a tight hug when
I got off the bus, but she didn't slam me with questions like I
thought she might. Her hug felt good, and I didn't shake it off like
some of the other kids were doing with their parents' hugs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
The bus driver started unloading our duffel bags, and I went to find
mine while Mom talked to Mr. Tushman and Ms. Rubin, who had walked
over to her. As I rolled my bag toward her, a lot of kids who don't
usually say anything to me were nodding hello, or patting my back as
I walked by them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.05in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Ready?&quot; Mom said when she saw me. She took my duffel bag,
and I didn't even try to hold on to it: I was fine with her carrying
it. If she had wanted to carry me on her shoulders, I would have been
fine with that, too, to be truthful.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">

Mom and I didn't talk much the whole walk home, and when we got to
the front stoop, I automatically looked in the front bay window,
because I forgot for a second that Daisy wasn't going to be there
like always, perched on the sofa with her front paws on the
windowsill, waiting for us to come home. It made me kind of sad when
we walked inside. As soon as we did, Mom dropped my duffel bag and
wrapped her arms around me and kissed me on my head and on my face
like she was breathing me in.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">&quot;It's

When I went back to school the next day, the first thing I noticed
was that there was a big shift in the way things were. A monumental
shift. A seismic shift. Maybe even a cosmic shift. Whatever you want
to call it, it was a big shift. Everyone—not just in our grade but
every grade—had heard about what had happened to us with the
seventh graders, so suddenly I wasn't known for what I'd always been
known for, but for this other thing that had happened. And the story
of what happened had gotten bigger and bigger each time it  was told.
Two days later, the way the story went was that  Amos had gotten into
a major fistfight with the kid, and Miles and Henry and Jack had
thrown some punches at the other guys, too. And the escape across the
field became this whole long adventure through a cornfield maze and
into the deep dark woods. Jack's version of the story was probably
the best because he's so funny, but in whatever version of the story,
and no matter who was telling it, two things always stayed the same:
I got picked on because of my face and Jack defended me, and those
guys— Amos, Henry, and Miles—protected me. And now that they'd
protected me, I was different to them. It was like I was one of them.

Another thing to come out of it was that Amos became super popular
and Julian, because he missed the whole thing, was really out of the
loop. Miles and Henry were hanging out with Amos all the time now,
like they switched best friends. I'd like to be able to say that
Julian started treating me better, too, but that wouldn't be true. He
still gave me dirty looks across the room. He still never talked to
me or Jack. But he was the only one who was like that now. And me and
Jack, we couldn't care less.</P>

&quot;Of course I remember, Auggie,&quot; he said softly. &quot;Ohh,
Auggie, don't be mad. I'm sorry. I just couldn't stand seeing you
wear that thing on your head anymore, you know? I didn't think it was
good for you.&quot; He was trying to look me in the eye, but I
wouldn't look at him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.11in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Come on, Auggie, please try to understand,&quot; he continued,
putting his hand under my chin and tilting my face toward him. &quot;You
were wearing that helmet all the time. And the real, real, real, real
truth is: I missed seeing your face, Auggie. I know you don't always
love it, but you have to understand . . . I love it. I love this face
of yours, Auggie, completely and passionately. And it kind of broke
my heart that you were always covering it up.&quot;</P>

&quot;She tore the place apart looking for that helmet, Dad,&quot; I

The auditorium was huge inside. Big sparkly chandeliers. Red velvet

giant stage. We walked down the wide aisle and followed the signs to
the fifth-grade staging area, which was in a big room to the left of
the stage. Inside were four rows of folding chairs facing the front
of the room, which is where Ms. Rubin was standing, waving us in as

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: always">
&quot;Thank you, Headmaster Jansen, for those very kind words of

Everyone applauded. &quot;Every year,&quot; continued Mr. Tushman,
reading from his  notes with his reading glasses way down on the tip
of his nose, &quot;I am charged with writing two commencement
addresses: one for the fifth- and sixth-grade graduation ceremony
today, and one for the seventh- and eighth-grade ceremony that will
take place tomorrow. And every year I say to myself, Let me cut down
on my work and write just one address that I can use for both
situations. Seems like it shouldn't be such a hard thing to do,
right? And yet each  year I still end up with two different speeches,
no matter what my intentions, and I finally figured out why this
year. It's not, as you might assume, simply because tomorrow I'll be
talking to an older crowd with a middle-school experience that is
largely behind them—whereas your middle-school experience is
largely in front of you. No, I think it has to do more with this
particular age that you are right now, this particular moment in your
lives that, even after twenty years of my being around students this
age, still moves me. Because you're at the cusp, kids. You're at the
edge between childhood and everything that comes after. You're in
transition.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;We are all gathered here together,&quot; Mr. Tushman continued,
taking off his glasses and using them to point at all of us in the
audience, &quot;all your families, friends, and teachers, to
celebrate not only your achievements of this past year, Beecher
middle schoolers— but your endless possibilities. &quot;When you
reflect on this past year, I want you all to look at where you are
now and where you've been. You've all gotten a little taller, a
little stronger, a little smarter . . . I hope.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">Here some

&quot;But the best way to measure how much you've grown isn't by
inches or the number of laps you can now run around the track, or
even your grade point average—though those things are important, to
be sure. It's what you've done with your time, how you've chosen to
spend your days, and whom you have touched this year. That, to me, is
the greatest measure of success.</P>

Here Mr. Tushman looked up at the audience. &quot;Kinder than is
necessary,&quot; he repeated. &quot;What a marvelous line, isn't it?
Kinder than is necessary. Because it's not enough to be kind. One
should be kinder than needed. Why I love that line, that concept, is
that it reminds me that we carry with us, as  human beings, not just
the capacity to be kind, but the very choice of kindness. And what
does that mean? How is that measured?</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 115%">You can't
use a yardstick. It's like I was saying just before: it's not like
measuring how much you've grown in a year. It's not exactly
quantifiable, is it? How do we know we've been kind? What is being
kind, anyway?&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">He put on

&quot;There's another passage in a different book I'd like to share
with you,&quot; he said. &quot;If you'll bear with me while I find
it. . . . Ah, here we go. In <I>Under the Eye of the Clock</I>, by
Christopher Nolan, the main character is a young man who  is facing
some extraordinary challenges. There's this one part where someone
helps him: a kid in his class. On the surface, it's a small gesture.
But to this young man, whose name is Joseph, it's . . . well, if
you'll permit me . . .&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
He cleared his throat and read from the book: &quot; 'It was at
moments such as these that Joseph recognized the face of God in human
form. It glimmered in their kindness to him, it glowed in their
keenness, it hinted in their caring, indeed it caressed in their
gaze.' &quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
He paused and took off his reading glasses again. &quot;It glimmered
in their kindness to him,&quot; he repeated, smiling. &quot;Such a
simple thing, kindness. Such a simple thing. A nice word of
encouragement given when needed. An act of friendship. A passing
smile.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in">He closed

I liked Mr. Tushman's speech, but I have to admit: I kind of zoned
out a little during some of the other speeches.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.17in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
I tuned in again as Ms. Rubin started reading off the names of the
kids who'd made the High Honor Roll because we were supposed to stand
up when our names were called. So I waited and listened for my name
as she went down the list alphabetically. Reid Kingsley. Maya
Markowitz. August Pullman. I stood up. Then when she finished reading
off the names, she asked us all to face the audience and take a bow,
and everyone applauded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.11in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
I had no idea where in that huge crowd my parents might be sitting.
All I could see were the flashes of light from people  taking photos
and parents waving at their kids. I pictured Mom waving at me from
somewhere even though I couldn't see her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Then Mr. Tushman came back to the podium to present the medals for
academic excellence, and Jack was right: Ximena Chin won the gold
medal for &quot;overall academic excellence in the fifth grade.&quot;
Charlotte won the silver. Charlotte also won a gold medal for music.
Amos won the medal for overall excellence in sports, which I was
really happy about because, ever since the nature retreat, I
considered Amos to  be like one of my best friends in school. But I
was really, really thrilled when Mr. Tushman called out Summer's name
for the gold medal in creative writing. I saw Summer put her hand
over her mouth when her name was called, and when she walked up onto
the stage, I yelled: &quot;Woo-hoo, Summer!&quot; as loudly as I
could, though I don't think she heard me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
After the last name was called, all the kids who'd just won awards
stood next to each other onstage, and Mr. Tushman said to the
audience: &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, I am very honored to present to
you this year's Beecher Prep School scholastic achievers.
Congratulations to all of you!&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.05in; page-break-before: always">
I applauded as the kids onstage bowed. I was so happy for Summer.</P>

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;The final award this morning,&quot; said Mr. Tushman, after the
kids onstage had returned to their seats, &quot;is the Henry Ward
Beecher medal to honor students who have been notable or exemplary in
certain areas throughout the school year.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.12in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Typically, this medal has been our way of acknowledging volunteerism
or service to the school.&quot; I immediately figured Charlotte would
get this medal because she organized the coat drive this year, so I
kind of zoned out a bit again. I looked at my watch: 10:56. I was
getting hungry for lunch already.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.05in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;. . . Henry Ward Beecher was, of course, the nineteenthcentury
abolitionist—and fiery sermonizer for human rights —after whom
this school was named,&quot; Mr. Tushman was saying when I started
paying attention again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; text-indent: 0.05in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;While reading up on his life in preparation for this award, I
came upon a passage that he wrote that seemed particularly consistent
with the themes I touched on earlier, themes I've been ruminating
upon all year long. Not just the nature of kindness, but the nature
of one's kindness. The power of <I>one's </I>friendship. The test of
<I>one's </I>character.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 0.19in">The
strength of <I>one's </I>courage—&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; line-height: 115%">
And here the weirdest thing happened: Mr. Tushman's voice cracked a
bit, like he got all choked up. He actually cleared his throat and
took a big sip of water. I started paying attention, for real now, to
what he was saying.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;The strength of one's courage,&quot; he repeated quietly,
nodding and smiling. He held up his right hand like he was counting
off. &quot;Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 115%">These are
the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel us, on
occasion, to greatness. And this is what the Henry Ward Beecher medal
is about: recognizing greatness. &quot;But how do we do that? How do
we measure something like greatness?</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; line-height: 115%">
Again, there's no yardstick for that kind of thing. How do we even
define it? Well, Beecher actually had an answer for that.&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
He put his reading glasses on again, leafed through a book, and
started to read. &quot; 'Greatness,' wrote Beecher, 'lies not in
being strong, but in the right using of strength. . .</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 0.19in">. He is
the greatest whose strength carries up the most hearts . . .' &quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0in">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="line-height: 115%">And again,
out of the blue, he got all choked up. He put his two index fingers
over his mouth for a second before continuing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.14in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot; 'He is the greatest,' &quot; he finally continued, &quot;
'whose strength carries up the most hearts by the attraction of his
own.' Without further ado, this year I am very proud to award the
Henry Ward Beecher medal to the student whose quiet strength has
carried up the most hearts.</P>

People started applauding before Mr. Tushman's words actually
registered in my brain. I heard Maya, who was next to me, give a
little happy scream when she heard my name, and Miles, who was on the
other side of me, patted my back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
&quot;Stand up, get up!&quot; said kids all around me, and I felt
lots of hands pushing me upward out of my seat, guiding me to the
edge of the row, patting my back, high-fiving me. &quot;Way to go,
Auggie!&quot; &quot;Nice going, Auggie!&quot; I even started hearing
my name being chanted: &quot;Aug-gie! Aug-gie! Aug-gie!&quot; I
looked back and saw Jack leading the chant, fist in the air, smiling
and signaling for me to keep going, and Amos shouting through his
hands: &quot;Woo-hoo, little dude!&quot;</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Then I saw Summer smiling as I walked past her row, and when she saw
me look at her, she gave me a secret little thumbs-up and mouthed a
silent &quot;cool beans&quot; to me. I laughed and shook my head like
I couldn't believe it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.14in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
I really couldn't believe it.  I think I was smiling. Maybe I was
beaming, I don't know. As I walked up the aisle toward the stage, all
I saw was a  blur of happy bright faces looking at me, and hands
clapping for me. And I heard people yelling things out at me: &quot;You
deserve it, Auggie!&quot; &quot;Good for you, Auggie!&quot; I saw all
my teachers in the aisle seats, Mr. Browne and Ms. Petosa and Mr.
Roche and Mrs. Atanabi and Nurse Molly and all the others: and they
were cheering for me, woo-hoo ing and whistling.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.12in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
I felt like I was floating. It was so weird. Like the sun was shining
full force on my face and the wind was blowing. As I got closer to
the stage, I saw Ms. Rubin waving at me in the front row, and then
next to her was Mrs. G, who was crying hysterically—a happy
crying—smiling and clapping the whole time. And as I walked up the
steps to the stage, the most amazing thing happened: everyone started
standing up. Not just the front rows, but the whole audience suddenly
got up on their feet, whooping, hollering, clapping like crazy. It
was a standing ovation. For me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.15in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
I walked across the stage to Mr. Tushman, who shook my hand with both
his hands and whispered in my ear: &quot;Well done, Auggie.&quot;
Then he placed the gold medal over my head, just like they do in the
Olympics, and had me turn to face the audience. It felt like I was
watching myself in a movie, almost, like I was someone else. It was
like that last scene in <I>Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope </I>when
Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca are being applauded for
destroying the Death Star.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: always">

No, that's not true. I knew why. It's like people you see sometimes,
and you can't imagine what it would be like to be that person,

Afterward there was a reception for the fifth and sixth graders under
a huge white tent in the back of the school. All the kids found their
parents, and I didn't mind at all when Mom and Dad hugged me like
crazy, or when Via wrapped her arms around me and swung me left and
right about twenty times. Then Poppa and Tata hugged me, and Aunt
Kate and Uncle Po, and Uncle Ben—everyone kind of teary-eyed and
wet- cheeked. But Miranda was the funniest: she was crying more than
anyone and squeezed me so tight that Via had to practically pry her
off of me, which made them both laugh.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.13in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
Everyone started taking pictures of me and pulling out their Flips,
and then Dad got me, Summer, and Jack together for a group shot. We
put our arms around each other's shoulders,  and for the first time I
can remember, I wasn't even thinking  about my face. I was just
smiling a big fat happy smile for all the different cameras clicking
away at me. Flash, flash, click, click : smiling away as Jack's
parents and Summer's mom started clicking. Then Reid and Maya came
over. Flash, flash, click, click. And then Charlotte came over and
asked if she could take a picture with us, and we were like, &quot;Sure,
of course!&quot; And then Charlotte's parents were snapping away at
our little group along with everyone else's parents.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.19in; margin-top: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">
And the next thing I knew, the two Maxes had come over, and Henry and
Miles, and Savanna. Then Amos came over, and Ximena. And we were all
in this big tight huddle as parents clicked away like we were on a
red carpet somewhere. Luca. Isaiah. Nino.</P>

Pablo. Tristan. Ellie. I lost track of who else came over. Everybody,
practically. All I knew for sure is that we were all laughing and
squeezing in tight against each other, and no one seemed to care if
it was my face that was next to theirs or not. In fact, and I don't
mean to brag here, but it kind of felt like everyone wanted to get
close to me.</P>

It was one of those great June days when the sky is completely blue
and the sun is shining but it isn't so hot that you wish you were on

I heard Dad's voice up ahead and looked up. He was telling everyone a

my amazing agent, Alyssa Eisner Henkin, for loving this manuscript
even in its earliest drafts and being such a strong champion for Jill
Aramor, R. J. Palacio, or whatever name I decided to call myself.
Thanks to Joan Slattery, whose joyful enthusiasm brought me to Knopf.
And most especially, thank you to Erin Clarke, editor extraordinaire,
who made this book as good as it could be and for taking such good
care of Auggie &amp; Company: I knew we were all in good hands. Thank
you to the wonderful team who worked on Wonder. Iris Broudy, I am
privileged to call you my copy editor. Kate Gartner and Tad
Carpenter, thank you for the brilliant jacket. Long before I wrote
this book, I was lucky to work side by side with copy editors,
proofreaders, designers, production managers, marketing assistants,
publicists, and all the men and women quietly toiling behind the
